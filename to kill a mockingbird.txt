when he was nearly thirteen my brother jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow when it healed and jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged he was seldom selfconscious about his injury his left arm was somewhat shorter than his right when he stood or walked the back of his hand was at right angles to his body his thumb parallel to his thigh he couldnt have cared less so long as he could pass and punt when enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident i maintain that the ewells started it all but jem who was four years my senior said it started long before that he said it began the summer dill came to us when dill first gave us the idea of making boo radley come out i said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing it really began with andrew jackson if general jackson hadnt run the creeks up the creek simon finch would never have paddled up the alabama and where would we be if he hadnt we were far too old to settle an argument with a fistfight so we consulted atticus our father said we were both right being southerners it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the battle of hastings all we had was simon finch a furtrapping apothecary from cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess in england simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren and as simon called himself a methodist he worked his way across the atlantic to philadelphia thence to jamaica thence to mobile and up the saint stephens mindful of john wesleys strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling simon made a pile practicing medicine but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of god as the putting on of gold and costly apparel so simon having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the alabama river some forty miles above saint stephens he returned to saint stephens only once to find a wife and with her established a line that ran high to daughters simon lived to an impressive age and died rich it was customary for the men in the family to remain on simons homestead finchs landing and make their living from cotton the place was selfsufficient modest in comparison with the empires around it the landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice wheat flour and articles of clothing supplied by riverboats from mobile simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north and the south as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century when my father atticus finch went to montgomery to read law and his younger brother went to boston to study medicine their sister alexandra was the finch who remained at the landing she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trotlines were full when my father was admitted to the bar he returned to maycomb and began his practice maycomb some twenty miles east of finchs landing was the county seat of maycomb county atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack a spittoon a checkerboard and an unsullied code of alabama his first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the maycomb county jail atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and escape with their lives but they were haverfords in maycomb county a name synonymous with jackass the haverfords had dispatched maycombs leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses and insisted that thesonofabitchhaditcomingtohim was a good enough defense for anybody they persisted in pleading not guilty to firstdegree murder so there was nothing much atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure an occasion that was probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminal law during his first five years in maycomb atticus practiced economy more than anything for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education john hale finch was ten years younger than my father and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing but after getting uncle jack started atticus derived a reasonable income from the law he liked maycomb he was maycomb county born and bred he knew his people they knew him and because of simon finchs industry atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town maycomb was an old town but it was a tired old town when i first knew it in rainy weather the streets turned to red slop grass grew on the sidewalks the courthouse sagged in the square somehow it was hotter then a black dog suffered on a summers day bony mules hitched to hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning ladies bathed before noon after their threeoclock naps and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum people moved slowly then they ambled across the square shuffled in and out of the stores around it took their time about everything a day was twentyfour hours long but seemed longer there was no hurry for there was nowhere to go nothing to buy and no money to buy it with nothing to see outside the boundaries of maycomb county but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself we lived on the main residential street in townatticus jem and i plus calpurnia our cook jem and i found our father satisfactory he played with us read to us and treated us with courteous detachment calpurnia was something else again she was all angles and bones she was nearsighted she squinted her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard she was always ordering me out of the kitchen asking me why i couldnt behave as well as jem when she knew he was older and calling me home when i wasnt ready to come our battles were epic and onesided calpurnia always won mainly because atticus always took her side she had been with us ever since jem was born and i had felt her tyrannical presence as long as i could remember our mother died when i was two so i never felt her absence she was a graham from montgomery atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature he was middleaged then she was fifteen years his junior jem was the product of their first year of marriage four years later i was born and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack they said it ran in her family i did not miss her but i think jem did he remembered her clearly and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length then go off and play by himself behind the carhouse when he was like that i knew better than to bother him when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten our summertime boundaries within calling distance of calpurnia were mrs henry lafayette duboses house two doors to the north of us and the radley place three doors to the south we were never tempted to break them the radley place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end mrs dubose was plain hell that was the summer dill came to us early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard jem and i heard something next door in miss rachel haverfords collard patch we went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy miss rachels rat terrier was expectinginstead we found someone sitting looking at us sitting down he wasnt much higher than the collards we stared at him until he spoke hey hey yourself said jem pleasantly im charles baker harris he said i can read so what i said i just thought youd like to know i can read you got anything needs readin i can do it how old are you asked jem fourandahalf goin on seven shoot no wonder then said jem jerking his thumb at me scout yonders been readin ever since she was born and she aint even started to school yet you look right puny for goin on seven im little but im old he said jem brushed his hair back to get a better look why dont you come over charles baker harris he said lord what a name s not any funniern yours aunt rachel says your names jeremy atticus finch jem scowled im big enough to fit mine he said your names longern you are bet its a foot longer folks call me dill said dill struggling under the fence do better if you go over it instead of under it i said whered you come from dill was from meridian mississippi was spending the summer with his aunt miss rachel and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on his family was from maycomb county originally his mother worked for a photographer in meridian had entered his picture in a beautiful child contest and won five dollars she gave the money to dill who went to the picture show twenty times on it dont have any picture shows here except jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes said jem ever see anything good dill had seen dracula a revelation that moved jem to eye him with the beginning of respect tell it to us he said dill was a curiosity he wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff he was a year my senior but i towered over him as he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken his laugh was sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead when dill reduced dracula to dust and jem said the show sounded better than the book i asked dill where his father was you aint said anything about him i havent got one is he dead no then if hes not dead youve got one havent you dill blushed and jem told me to hush a sure sign that dill had been studied and found acceptable thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment routine contentment was improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard fussing running through our list of dramas based on the works of oliver optic victor appleton and edgar rice burroughs in this matter we were lucky to have dill he played the character parts formerly thrust upon methe ape in tarzan mr crabtree in the rover boys mr damon in tom swift thus we came to know dill as a pocket merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plans strange longings and quaint fancies but by the end of august our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions and it was then that dill gave us the idea of making boo radley come out the radley place fascinated dill in spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water but drew him no nearer than the lightpole on the corner a safe distance from the radley gate there he would stand his arm around the fat pole staring and wondering the radley place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house walking south one faced its porch the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot the house was low was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters but had long ago darkened to the color of the slategray yard around it rainrotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda oak trees kept the sun away the remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yarda swept yard that was never sweptwhere johnson grass and rabbittobacco grew in abundance inside the house lived a malevolent phantom people said he existed but jem and i had never seen him people said he went out at night when the moon was down and peeped in windows when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap it was because he had breathed on them any stealthy small crimes committed in maycomb were his work once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated although the culprit was crazy addie who eventually drowned himself in barkers eddy people still looked at the radley place unwilling to discard their initial suspicions a negro would not pass the radley place at night he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked the maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the radley lot from the radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nuts lay untouched by the children radley pecans would kill you a baseball hit into the radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked the misery of that house began many years before jem and i were born the radleys welcome anywhere in town kept to themselves a predilection unforgivable in maycomb they did not go to church maycombs principal recreation but worshiped at home mrs radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a midmorning coffee break with her neighbors and certainly never joined a missionary circle mr radley walked to town at eleventhirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries i never knew how old mr radley made his livingjem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothingbut mr radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember the shutters and doors of the radley house were closed on sundays another thing alien to maycombs ways closed doors meant illness and cold weather only of all days sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting ladies wore corsets men wore coats children wore shoes but to climb the radley front steps and call hey of a sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did the radley house had no screen doors i once asked atticus if it ever had any atticus said yes but before i was born according to neighborhood legend when the younger radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the cunninghams from old sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in maycomb they did little but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits they hung around the barbershop they rode the bus to abbottsville on sundays and went to the picture show they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling hell the dewdrop inn fishing camp they experimented with stumphole whiskey nobody in maycomb had nerve enough to tell mr radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd one night in an excessive spurt of high spirits the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver resisted arrest by maycombs ancient beadle mr conner and locked him in the courthouse outhouse the town decided something had to be done mr conner said he knew who each and every one of them was and he was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct disturbing the peace assault and battery and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female the judge asked mr conner why he included the last charge mr conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in maycomb heard them the judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter it was no prison and it was no disgrace mr radley thought it was if the judge released arthur mr radley would see to it that arthur gave no further trouble knowing that mr radleys word was his bond the judge was glad to do so the other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at auburn the doors of the radley house were closed on weekdays as well as sundays and mr radleys boy was not seen again for fifteen years but there came a day barely within jems memory when boo radley was heard from and was seen by several people but not by jem he said atticus never talked much about the radleys when jem would question him atticuss only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened jem said atticus shook his head and said mm mm mm so jem received most of his information from miss stephanie crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing according to miss stephanie boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from the maycomb tribune to paste in his scrapbook his father entered the room as mr radley passed by boo drove the scissors into his parents leg pulled them out wiped them on his pants and resumed his activities mrs radley ran screaming into the street that arthur was killing them all but when the sheriff arrived he found boo still sitting in the livingroom cutting up the tribune he was thirtythree years old then miss stephanie said old mr radley said no radley was going to any asylum when it was suggested that a season in tuscaloosa might be helpful to boo boo wasnt crazy he was highstrung at times it was all right to shut him up mr radley conceded but insisted that boo not be charged with anything he was not a criminal the sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside negroes so boo was locked in the courthouse basement boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in jems memory miss stephanie crawford said some of the town council told mr radley that if he didnt take boo back boo would die of mold from the damp besides boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county nobody knew what form of intimidation mr radley employed to keep boo out of sight but jem figured that mr radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time atticus said no it wasnt that sort of thing that there were other ways of making people into ghosts my memory came alive to see mrs radley occasionally open the front door walk to the edge of the porch and pour water on her cannas but every day jem and i would see mr radley walking to and from town he was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes so colorless they did not reflect light his cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip miss stephanie crawford said he was so upright he took the word of god as his only law and we believed her because mr radleys posture was ramrod straight he never spoke to us when he passed we would look at the ground and say good morning sir and he would cough in reply mr radleys elder son lived in pensacola he came home at christmas and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place from the day mr radley took arthur home people said the house died but there came a day when atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us mr radley was dying he took his time about it wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the radley lot straw was put down on the sidewalk traffic was diverted to the back street dr reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the radleys every time he called jem and i crept around the yard for days at last the sawhorses were taken away and we stood watching from the front porch when mr radley made his final journey past our house there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia and she spat meditatively into the yard we looked at her in surprise for calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people the neighborhood thought when mr radley went under boo would come out but it had another think coming boos elder brother returned from pensacola and took mr radleys place the only difference between him and his father was their ages jem said mr nathan radley bought cotton too mr nathan would speak to us however when we said good morning and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know the longer he would stand hugging the lightpole on the corner the more he would wonder wonder what he does in there he would murmur looks like hed just stick his head out the door jem said he goes out all right when its pitch dark miss stephanie crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her said his head was like a skull lookin at her aint you ever waked up at night and heard him dill he walks like this jem slid his feet through the gravel why do you think miss rachel locks up so tight at night ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching on the back screen but he was gone time atticus got there wonder what he looks like said dill jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo was about sixandahalf feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch thats why his hands were bloodstainedif you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off there was a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eyes popped and he drooled most of the time lets try to make him come out said dill id like to see what he looks like jem said if dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door our first raid came to pass only because dill bet jem the gray ghost against two tom swifts that jem wouldnt get any farther than the radley gate in all his life jem had never declined a dare jem thought about it for three days i suppose he loved honor more than his head for dill wore him down easily youre scared dill said the first day aint scared just respectful jem said the next day dill said youre too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard jem said he reckoned he wasnt hed passed the radley place every school day of his life always runnin i said but dill got him the third day when he told jem that folks in meridian certainly werent as afraid as the folks in maycomb that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones in maycomb this was enough to make jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the lightpole watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge i hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one dill harris said jem when we joined him dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out you started it remember youre still scared murmured dill patiently jem wanted dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything its just that i cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us besides jem had his little sister to think of when he said that i knew he was afraid jem had his little sister to think of the time i dared him to jump off the top of the house if i got killed whatd become of you he asked then he jumped landed unhurt and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the radley place you gonna run out on a dare asked dill if you are then dill you have to think about these things jem said lemme think a minute its sort of like making a turtle come out hows that asked dill strike a match under him i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i was going to tell atticus on him dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful aint hateful just persuades hims not like youd chunk him in the fire jem growled how do you know a match dont hurt him turtles cant feel stupid said jem were you ever a turtle huh my stars dill now lemme think reckon we can rock him jem stood in thought so long that dill made a mild concession i wont say you ran out on a dare an ill swap you the gray ghost if you just go up and touch the house jem brightened touch the house that all dill nodded sure thats all now i dont want you hollerin something different the minute i get back yeah thats all said dill hell probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aint gonna hurt him we left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the radley house and stopped at the gate well go on said dill scout and mes right behind you im going said jem dont hurry me he walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head then i sneered at him jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past us not waiting to see if his foray was successful dill and i followed on his heels safely on our porch panting and out of breath we looked back the old house was the same droopy and sick but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move flick a tiny almost invisible movement and the house was still dill left us early in september to return to meridian we saw him off on the five oclock bus and i was miserable without him until it occurred to me that i would be starting to school in a week i never looked forward more to anything in my life hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse looking over at the schoolyard spying on multitudes of children through a twopower telescope jem had given me learning their games following jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories i longed to join them jem condescended to take me to school the first day a job usually done by ones parents but atticus had said jem would be delighted to show me where my room was i think some money changed hands in this transaction for as we trotted around the corner past the radley place i heard an unfamiliar jingle in jems pockets when we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard jem was careful to explain that during school hours i was not to bother him i was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of tarzan and the ant men to embarrass him with references to his private life or tag along behind him at recess and noon i was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth in short i was to leave him alone you mean we cant play any more i asked well do like we always do at home he said but youll seeschools different it certainly was before the first morning was over miss caroline fisher our teacher hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler then made me stand in the corner until noon miss caroline was no more than twentyone she had bright auburn hair pink cheeks and wore crimson fingernail polish she also wore highheeled pumps and a redandwhitestriped dress she looked and smelled like a peppermint drop she boarded across the street one door down from us in miss maudie atkinsons upstairs front room and when miss maudie introduced us to her jem was in a haze for days miss caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said this says i am miss caroline fisher i am from north alabama from winston county the class murmured apprehensively should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region when alabama seceded from the union on january winston county seceded from alabama and every child in maycomb county knew it north alabama was full of liquor interests big mules steel companies republicans professors and other persons of no background miss caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats the cats had long conversations with one another they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove by the time mrs cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms miss caroline seemed unaware that the ragged denimshirted and floursackskirted first grade most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk were immune to imaginative literature miss caroline came to the end of the story and said oh my wasnt that nice then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals turned to the class and asked does anybody know what these are everybody did most of the first grade had failed it last year i suppose she chose me because she knew my name as i read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows and after making me read most of my first reader and the stockmarket quotations from the mobile register aloud she discovered that i was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste miss caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more it would interfere with my reading teach me i said in surprise he hasnt taught me anything miss caroline atticus aint got time to teach me anything i added when miss caroline smiled and shook her head why hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads if he didnt teach you who did miss caroline asked goodnaturedly somebody did you werent born reading the mobile register jem says i was he read in a book where i was a bullfinch instead of a finch jem says my names really jean louise bullfinch that i got swapped when i was born and im really a miss caroline apparently thought i was lying lets not let our imaginations run away with us dear she said now you tell your father not to teach you any more its best to begin reading with a fresh mind you tell him ill take over from here and try to undo the damage maam your father does not know how to teach you can have a seat now i mumbled that i was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime i never deliberately learned to read but somehow i had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers in the long hours of churchwas it then i learned i could not remember not being able to read hymns now that i was compelled to think about it reading was something that just came to me as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces i could not remember when the lines above atticuss moving finger separated into words but i had stared at them all the evenings in my memory listening to the news of the day bills to be enacted into laws the diaries of lorenzo dowanything atticus happened to be reading when i crawled into his lap every night until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read one does not love breathing i knew i had annoyed miss caroline so i let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when jem cut me from the covey of firstgraders in the schoolyard he asked how i was getting along i told him if i didnt have to stay id leave jem that damn lady says atticuss been teaching me to read and for him to stop it dont worry scout jem comforted me our teacher says miss carolines introducing a new way of teaching she learned about it in college itll be in all the grades soon you dont have to learn much out of books that wayits like if you wanta learn about cows you go milk one see yeah jem but i dont wanta study cows i sure you do you hafta know about cows theyre a big part of life in maycomb county i contented myself with asking jem if hed lost his mind im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade stubborn its the dewey decimal system having never questioned jems pronouncements i saw no reason to begin now the dewey decimal system consisted in part of miss caroline waving cards at us on which were printed the cat rat man and you no comment seemed to be expected of us and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence i was bored so i began a letter to dill miss caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me besides she said we dont write in the first grade we print you wont learn to write until youre in the third grade calpurnia was to blame for this it kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days i guess she would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet then copying out a chapter of the bible beneath if i reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily she rewarded me with an openfaced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar in calpurnias teaching there was no sentimentality i seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands said miss caroline breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia the town children did so and she looked us over everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk molasses buckets appeared from nowhere and the ceiling danced with metallic light miss caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers nodding if the contents pleased her frowning a little at others she stopped at walter cunninghams desk wheres yours she asked walter cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms his absence of shoes told us how he got them people caught hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows if walter had owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until midwinter he did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls did you forget your lunch this morning asked miss caroline walter looked straight ahead i saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw did you forget it this morning asked miss caroline walters jaw twitched again yebm he finally mumbled miss caroline went to her desk and opened her purse heres a quarter she said to walter go and eat downtown today you can pay me back tomorrow walter shook his head nome thank you maam he drawled softly impatience crept into miss carolines voice here walter come get it walter shook his head again when walter shook his head a third time someone whispered go on and tell her scout i turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me miss caroline and i had conferred twice already and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding i rose graciously on walters behalf ahmiss caroline what is it jean louise miss caroline hes a cunningham i sat back down what jean louise i thought i had made things sufficiently clear it was clear enough to the rest of us walter cunningham was sitting there lying his head off he didnt forget his lunch he didnt have any he had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day he had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life i tried again walters one of the cunninghams miss caroline i beg your pardon jean louise thats okay maam youll get to know all the county folks after a while the cunninghams never took anything they cant pay backno church baskets and no scrip stamps they never took anything off of anybody they get along on what they have they dont have much but they get along on it my special knowledge of the cunningham tribeone branch that iswas gained from events of last winter walters father was one of atticuss clients after a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment before mr cunningham left he said mr finch i dont know when ill ever be able to pay you let that be the least of your worries walter atticus said when i asked jem what entailment was and jem described it as a condition of having your tail in a crack i asked atticus if mr cunningham would ever pay us not in money atticus said but before the years out ill have been paid you watch we watched one morning jem and i found a load of stovewood in the back yard later a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps with christmas came a crate of smilax and holly that spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens atticus said mr cunningham had more than paid him why does he pay you like that i asked because thats the only way he can pay me he has no money are we poor atticus atticus nodded we are indeed jems nose wrinkled are we as poor as the cunninghams not exactly the cunninghams are country folks farmers and the crash hit them hardest atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor as maycomb county was farm country nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers entailment was only a part of mr cunninghams vexations the acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt and the little cash he made went to interest if he held his mouth right mr cunningham could get a wpa job but his land would go to ruin if he left it and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased mr cunningham said atticus came from a set breed of men as the cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer they simply paid us with what they had did you know said atticus that dr reynolds works the same way he charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby miss scout if you give me your attention ill tell you what entailment is jems definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes if i could have explained these things to miss caroline i would have saved myself some inconvenience and miss caroline subsequent mortification but it was beyond my ability to explain things as well as atticus so i said youre shamin him miss caroline walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you and you cant use any stovewood miss caroline stood stock still then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk jean louise ive had about enough of you this morning she said youre starting off on the wrong foot in every way my dear hold out your hand i thought she was going to spit in it which was the only reason anybody in maycomb held out his hand it was a timehonored method of sealing oral contracts wondering what bargain we had made i turned to the class for an answer but the class looked back at me in puzzlement miss caroline picked up her ruler gave me half a dozen quick little pats then told me to stand in the corner a storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that miss caroline had whipped me when miss caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again becoming cold sober only when the shadow of miss blount fell over them miss blount a native maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the decimal system appeared at the door hands on hips and announced if i hear another sound from this room ill burn up everybody in it miss caroline the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket my sojourn in the corner was a short one saved by the bell miss caroline watched the class file out for lunch as i was the last to leave i saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arms had her conduct been more friendly toward me i would have felt sorry for her she was a pretty little thing catching walter cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure but when i was rubbing his nose in the dirt jem came by and told me to stop youre biggern he is he said hes as old as you nearly i said he made me start off on the wrong foot let him go scout why he didnt have any lunch i said and explained my involvement in walters dietary affairs walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to jem and me his fists were half cocked as if expecting an onslaught from both of us i stomped at him to chase him away but jem put out his hand and stopped me he examined walter with an air of speculation your daddy mr walter cunningham from old sarum he asked and walter nodded walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food his eyes as blue as dill harriss were redrimmed and watery there was no color in his face except at the tip of his nose which was moistly pink he fingered the straps of his overalls nervously picking at the metal hooks jem suddenly grinned at him come on home to dinner with us walter he said wed be glad to have you walters face brightened then darkened jem said our daddys a friend of your daddys scout here shes crazyshe wont fight you any more i wouldnt be too certain of that i said jems free dispensation of my pledge irked me but precious noontime minutes were ticking away yeah walter i wont jump on you again dont you like butterbeans our cals a real good cook walter stood where he was biting his lip jem and i gave up and we were nearly to the radley place when walter called hey im comin when walter caught up with us jem made pleasant conversation with him a haint lives there he said cordially pointing to the radley house ever hear about him walter reckon i have said walter almost died first year i come to school and et them pecansfolks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence jem seemed to have little fear of boo radley now that walter and i walked beside him indeed jem grew boastful i went all the way up to the house once he said to walter anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passes it i said to the clouds above and whos runnin miss priss you are when aint anybody with you by the time we reached our front steps walter had forgotten he was a cunningham jem ran to the kitchen and asked calpurnia to set an extra plate we had company atticus greeted walter and began a discussion about crops neither jem nor i could follow reason i cant pass the first grade mr finch is ive had to stay out ever spring an help papa with the choppin but theres anothern at the house now thats field size did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him i asked but atticus shook his head at me while walter piled food on his plate he and atticus talked together like two men to the wonderment of jem and me atticus was expounding upon farm problems when walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house atticus summoned calpurnia who returned bearing the syrup pitcher she stood waiting for walter to help himself walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand he would probably have poured it into his milk glass had i not asked what the sam hill he was doing the silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher and he quickly put his hands in his lap then he ducked his head atticus shook his head at me again but hes gone and drowned his dinner in syrup i protested hes poured it all over it was then that calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen she was furious and when she was furious calpurnias grammar became erratic when in tranquility her grammar was as good as anybodys in maycomb atticus said calpurnia had more education than most colored folks when she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened theres some folks who dont eat like us she whispered fiercely but you aint called on to contradict em at the table when they dont that boys yo compny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him you hear he aint company cal hes just a cunningham hush your mouth dont matter who they are anybody sets foot in this houses yo compny and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you was so high and mighty yo folks might be bettern the cunninghams but it dont count for nothin the way youre disgracin emif you cant act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack i retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen thankful though that i was spared the humiliation of facing them again i told calpurnia to just wait id fix her one of these days when she wasnt looking id go off and drown myself in barkers eddy and then shed be sorry besides i added shed already gotten me in trouble once today she had taught me to write and it was all her fault hush your fussin she said jem and walter returned to school ahead of me staying behind to advise atticus of calpurnias iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the radley place she likes jem bettern she likes me anyway i concluded and suggested that atticus lose no time in packing her off have you ever considered that jem doesnt worry her half as much atticuss voice was flinty ive no intention of getting rid of her now or ever we couldnt operate a single day without cal have you ever thought of that you think about how much cal does for you and you mind her you hear i returned to school and hated calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentments i looked up to see miss caroline standing in the middle of the room sheer horror flooding her face apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession its alive she screamed the male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance lord i thought shes scared of a mouse little chuck little whose patience with all living things was phenomenal said which way did he go miss caroline tell us where he went quick dc he turned to a boy behind himdc shut the door and well catch him quick maam whered he go miss caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk but to a hulking individual unknown to me little chucks face contracted and he said gently you mean him maam yessum hes alive did he scare you some way miss caroline said desperately i was just walking by when it crawled out of his hair just crawled out of his hair little chuck grinned broadly there aint no need to fear a cootie maam aint you ever seen one now dont you be afraid you just go back to your desk and teach us some more little chuck little was another member of the population who didnt know where his next meal was coming from but he was a born gentleman he put his hand under her elbow and led miss caroline to the front of the room now dont you fret maam he said there aint no need to fear a cootie ill just fetch you some cool water the cooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought he searched the scalp above his forehead located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger miss caroline watched the process in horrid fascination little chuck brought water in a paper cup and she drank it gratefully finally she found her voice what is your name son she asked softly the boy blinked who me miss caroline nodded burris ewell miss caroline inspected her rollbook i have a ewell here but i dont have a first name would you spell your first name for me dont know how they call me burrist home well burris said miss caroline i think wed better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon i want you to go home and wash your hair from her desk she produced a thick volume leafed through its pages and read for a moment a good home remedy forburris i want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap when youve done that treat your scalp with kerosene what fer missus to get rid of theer cooties you see burris the other children might catch them and you wouldnt want that would you the boy stood up he was the filthiest human i had ever seen his neck was dark gray the backs of his hands were rusty and his fingernails were black deep into the quick he peered at miss caroline from a fistsized clean space on his face no one had noticed him probably because miss caroline and i had entertained the class most of the morning and burris said miss caroline please bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow the boy laughed rudely you aint sendin me home missus i was on the verge of leavini done done my time for this year miss caroline looked puzzled what do you mean by that the boy did not answer he gave a short contemptuous snort one of the elderly members of the class answered her hes one of the ewells maam and i wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt but miss caroline seemed willing to listen whole schools full of em they come first day every year and then leave the truant lady gets em here cause she threatens em with the sheriff but shes give up tryin to hold em she reckons shes carried out the law just gettin their names on the roll and runnin em here the first day youre supposed to mark em absent the rest of the year but what about their parents asked miss caroline in genuine concern aint got no mother was the answer and their paws right contentious burris ewell was flattered by the recital been comin to the first day o the first grade fer three year now he said expansively reckon if im smart this year theyll promote me to the second miss caroline said sit back down please burris and the moment she said it i knew she had made a serious mistake the boys condescension flashed to anger you try and make me missus little chuck little got to his feet let him go maam he said hes a mean one a harddown mean one hes liable to start somethin and theres some little folks here he was among the most diminutive of men but when burris ewell turned toward him little chucks right hand went to his pocket watch your step burris he said id soons kill you as look at you now go home burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height and miss caroline took advantage of his indecision burris go home if you dont ill call the principal she said ill have to report this anyway the boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door safely out of range he turned and shouted report and be damned to ye aint no snotnosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born cn make me do nothin you aint makin me go nowhere missus you just remember that you aint makin me go nowhere he waited until he was sure she was crying then he shuffled out of the building soon we were clustered around her desk trying in our various ways to comfort her he was a real mean one below the belt you aint called on to teach folks like that them aint maycombs ways miss caroline not really now dont you fret maam miss caroline why dont you read us a story that cat thing was real fine this mornin miss caroline smiled blew her nose said thank you darlings dispersed us opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall when i passed the radley place for the fourth time that daytwice at a full gallopmy gloom had deepened to match the house if the remainder of the school year were as fraught with drama as the first day perhaps it would be mildly entertaining but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think of running away by late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete when jem and i raced each other up the sidewalk to meet atticus coming home from work i didnt give him much of a race it was our habit to run meet atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace he was full of questions about school my replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me perhaps calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one she let me watch her fix supper shut your eyes and open your mouth and ill give you a surprise she said it was not often that she made crackling bread she said she never had time but with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her she knew i loved crackling bread i missed you today she said the house got so lonesome long about two oclock i had to turn on the radio why jemn me aint ever in the house unless its rainin i know she said but one of yous always in callin distance i wonder how much of the day i spend just callin after you well she said getting up from the kitchen chair its enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread i reckon you run along now and let me get supper on the table calpurnia bent down and kissed me i ran along wondering what had come over her she had wanted to make up with me that was it she had always been too hard on me she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways she was sorry and too stubborn to say so i was weary from the days crimes after supper atticus sat down with the paper and called scout ready to read the lord sent me more than i could bear and i went to the front porch atticus followed me something wrong scout i told atticus i didnt feel very well and didnt think id go to school any more if it was all right with him atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs his fingers wandered to his watchpocket he said that was the only way he could think he waited in amiable silence and i sought to reinforce my position you never went to school and you do all right so ill just stay home too you can teach me like granddaddy taught you n uncle jack no i cant said atticus i have to make a living besides theyd put me in jail if i kept you at homedose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow im feeling all right really thought so now whats the matter bit by bit i told him the days misfortunes and she said you taught me all wrong so we cant ever read any more ever please dont send me back please sir atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch when he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me first of all he said if you can learn a simple trick scout youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view sir until you climb into his skin and walk around in it atticus said i had learned many things today and miss caroline had learned several things herself she had learned not to hand something to a cunningham for one thing but if walter and i had put ourselves in her shoes wed have seen it was an honest mistake on her part we could not expect her to learn all maycombs ways in one day and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better ill be dogged i said i didnt know no better than not to read to her and she held me responsiblelisten atticus i dont have to go to school i was bursting with a sudden thought burris ewell remember he just goes to school the first day the truant lady reckons shes carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll you cant do that scout atticus said sometimes its better to bend the law a little in special cases in your case the law remains rigid so to school you must go i dont see why i have to when he doesnt then listen atticus said the ewells had been the disgrace of maycomb for three generations none of them had done an honest days work in his recollection he said that some christmas when he was getting rid of the tree he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived they were people but they lived like animals they can go to school any time they want to when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education said atticus there are ways of keeping them in school by force but its silly to force people like the ewells into a new environment if i didnt go to school tomorrow youd force me to let us leave it at this said atticus dryly you miss scout finch are of the common folk you must obey the law he said that the ewells were members of an exclusive society made up of ewells in certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the ewells activities they didnt have to go to school for one thing another thing mr bob ewell burriss father was permitted to hunt and trap out of season atticus thats bad i said in maycomb county hunting out of season was a misdemeanor at law a capital felony in the eyes of the populace its against the law all right said my father and its certainly bad but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains i dont know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit mr ewell shouldnt do that of course he shouldnt but hell never change his ways are you going to take out your disapproval on his children no sir i murmured and made a final stand but if i keep on goin to school we cant ever read any more thats really bothering you isnt it yes sir when atticus looked down at me i saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something do you know what a compromise is he asked bending the law no an agreement reached by mutual concessions it works this way he said if youll concede the necessity of going to school well go on reading every night just as we always have is it a bargain yes sir well consider it sealed without the usual formality atticus said when he saw me preparing to spit as i opened the front screen door atticus said by the way scout youd better not say anything at school about our agreement why not im afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authorities jem and i were accustomed to our fathers lastwillandtestament diction and we were at all times free to interrupt atticus for a translation when it was beyond our understanding huh sir i never went to school he said but i have a feeling that if you tell miss caroline we read every night shell get after me and i wouldnt want her after me atticus kept us in fits that evening gravely reading columns of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason which was reason enough for jem to spend the following saturday aloft in the treehouse jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not atticus severed his supply lines i had spent most of the day climbing up and down running errands for him providing him with literature nourishment and water and was carrying him blankets for the night when atticus said if i paid no attention to him jem would come down atticus was right the remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first indeed they were an endless project that slowly evolved into a unit in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the state of alabama in its wellmeaning but fruitless efforts to teach me group dynamics what jem called the dewey decimal system was schoolwide by the end of my first year so i had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques i could only look around me atticus and my uncle who went to school at home knew everythingat least what one didnt know the other did furthermore i couldnt help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature elected each time without opposition innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of good citizenship jem educated on a halfdecimal halfduncecap basis seemed to function effectively alone or in a group but jem was a poor example no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books as for me i knew nothing except what i gathered from time magazine and reading everything i could lay hands on at home but as i inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the maycomb county school system i could not help receiving the impression that i was being cheated out of something out of what i knew not yet i did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me as the year passed released from school thirty minutes before jem who had to stay until three oclock i ran by the radley place as fast as i could not stopping until i reached the safety of our front porch one afternoon as i raced by something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that i took a deep breath a long look around and went back two live oaks stood at the edge of the radley lot their roots reached out into the sideroad and made it bumpy something about one of the trees attracted my attention some tinfoil was sticking in a knothole just above my eye level winking at me in the afternoon sun i stood on tiptoe hastily looked around once more reached into the hole and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers my first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible but i remembered where i was i ran home and on our front porch i examined my loot the gum looked fresh i sniffed it and it smelled all right i licked it and waited for a while when i did not die i crammed it into my mouth wrigleys doublemint when jem came home he asked me where i got such a wad i told him i found it dont eat things you find scout this wasnt on the ground it was in a tree jem growled well it was i said it was sticking in that tree yonder the one comin from school spit it out right now i spat it out the tang was fading anyway ive been chewin it all afternoon and i aint dead yet not even sick jem stamped his foot dont you know youre not supposed to even touch the trees over there youll get killed if you do you touched the house once that was different you go gargleright now you hear me aint neither itll take the taste outa my mouth you dont n ill tell calpurnia on you rather than risk a tangle with calpurnia i did as jem told me for some reason my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship calpurnias tyranny unfairness and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval on my part i went to much trouble sometimes not to provoke her summer was on the way jem and i awaited it with impatience summer was our best season it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots or trying to sleep in the treehouse summer was everything good to eat it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape but most of all summer was dill the authorities released us early the last day of school and jem and i walked home together reckon old dillll be coming home tomorrow i said probably day after said jem missippi turns em loose a day later as we came to the live oaks at the radley place i raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knothole where i had found the chewing gum trying to make jem believe i had found it there and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil i see it scout i see it jem looked around reached up and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package we ran home and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewinggum wrappers it was the kind of box wedding rings came in purple velvet with a minute catch jem flicked open the tiny catch inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies one on top of the other jem examined them indianheads he said nineteensix and scout one of ems nineteenhundred these are real old nineteenhundred i echoed say hush a minute im thinkin jem you reckon thats somebodys hidin place naw dont anybody much but us pass by there unless its some grown persons grown folks dont have hidin places you reckon we ought to keep em jem i dont know what we could do scout whod we give em back to i know for a fact dont anybody go by therececil goes by the back street an all the way around by town to get home cecil jacobs who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the radley place and old mrs henry lafayette dubose mrs dubose lived two doors up the street from us neighborhood opinion was unanimous that mrs dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived jem wouldnt go by her place without atticus beside him what you reckon we oughta do jem finders were keepers unless title was proven plucking an occasional camellia getting a squirt of hot milk from miss maudie atkinsons cow on a summer day helping ourselves to someones scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture but money was different tell you what said jem well keep em till school starts then go around and ask everybody if theyre theirs theyre some bus childs maybehe was too taken up with gettin outa school today an forgot em these are somebodys i know that see how theyve been slicked up theyve been saved yeah but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that you know it doesnt last i dont know scout but these are important to somebody hows that jem well indianheadswell they come from the indians theyre real strong magic they make you have good luck not like fried chicken when youre not lookin for it but things like long life n good health n passin sixweeks tests these are real valuable to somebody im gonna put em in my trunk before jem went to his room he looked for a long time at the radley place he seemed to be thinking again two days later dill arrived in a blaze of glory he had ridden the train by himself from meridian to maycomb junction a courtesy title maycomb junction was in abbott county where he had been met by miss rachel in maycombs one taxi he had eaten dinner in the diner he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in bay st louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats he had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt he was somewhat heavier no taller and said he had seen his father dills father was taller than ours he had a black beard pointed and was president of the l n railroad i helped the engineer for a while said dill yawning in a pigs ear you did dill hush said jem whatll we play today tom and sam and dick said dill lets go in the front yard dill wanted the rover boys because there were three respectable parts he was clearly tired of being our character man im tired of those i said i was tired of playing tom rover who suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the end when he was found in alaska make us up one jem i said im tired of makin em up our first days of freedom and we were tired i wondered what the summer would bring we had strolled to the front yard where dill stood looking down the street at the dreary face of the radley place ismelldeath he said i do i mean it he said when i told him to shut up you mean when somebodys dyin you can smell it no i mean i can smell somebody an tell if theyre gonna die an old lady taught me how dill leaned over and sniffed me jeanlouisefinch you are going to die in three days dill if you dont hush ill knock you bowlegged i mean it now yawl hush growled jem you act like you believe in hot steams you act like you dont i said whats a hot steam asked dill havent you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place jem asked dill a hot steams somebody who cant get to heaven just wallows around on lonesome roads an if you walk through him when you die youll be one too an youll go around at night suckin peoples breath how can you keep from passing through one you cant said jem sometimes they stretch all the way across the road but if you hafta go through one you say angelbright lifeindeath get off the road dont suck my breath that keeps em from wrapping around you dont you believe a word he says dill i said calpurnia says thats niggertalk jem scowled darkly at me but said well are we gonna play anything or not lets roll in the tire i suggested jem sighed you know im too big you cn push i ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house i slapped it up to the front yard im first i said dill said he ought to be first he just got here jem arbitrated awarded me first push with an extra time for dill and i folded myself inside the tire until it happened i did not realize that jem was offended by my contradicting him on hot steams and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me he did by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body ground sky and houses melted into a mad palette my ears throbbed i was suffocating i could not put out my hands to stop they were wedged between my chest and knees i could only hope that jem would outrun the tire and me or that i would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk i heard him behind me chasing and shouting the tire bumped on gravel skeetered across the road crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement dizzy and nauseated i lay on the cement and shook my head still pounded my ears to silence and heard jems voice scout get away from there come on i raised my head and stared at the radley place steps in front of me i froze come on scout dont just lie there jem was screaming get up cantcha i got to my feet trembling as i thawed get the tire jem hollered bring it with you aint you got any sense at all when i was able to navigate i ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me why didnt you bring it jem yelled why dont you get it i screamed jem was silent go on it aint far inside the gate why you even touched the house once remember jem looked at me furiously could not decline ran down the sidewalk treaded water at the gate then dashed in and retrieved the tire see there jem was scowling triumphantly nothin to it i swear scout sometimes you act so much like a girl its mortifyin there was more to it than he knew but i decided not to tell him calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled lemonade time you all get in outa that hot sun fore you fry alive lemonade in the middle of the morning was a summertime ritual calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch then went about her business being out of jems good graces did not worry me especially lemonade would restore his good humor jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest i know what we are going to play he announced something new something different what asked dill boo radley jems head at times was transparent he had thought that up to make me understand he wasnt afraid of radleys in any shape or form to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice boo radley how asked dill jem said scout you can be mrs radley i declare if i will i dont think smatter said dill still scared he can get out at night when were all asleep i said jem hissed scout hows he gonna know what were doin besides i dont think hes still there he died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney dill said jem you and me can play and scout can watch if shes scared i was fairly sure boo radley was inside that house but i couldnt prove it and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or i would be accused of believing in hot steams phenomena i was immune to in the daytime jem parceled out our roles i was mrs radley and all i had to do was come out and sweep the porch dill was old mr radley he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when jem spoke to him jem naturally was boo he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time as the summer progressed so did our game we polished and perfected it added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changes every day dill was a villains villain he could get into any character part assigned him and appear tall if height was part of the devilry required he was as good as his worst performance his worst performance was gothic i reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script i never thought it as much fun as tarzan and i played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite jems assurances that boo radley was dead and nothing would get me with him and calpurnia there in the daytime and atticus home at night jem was a born hero it was a melancholy little drama woven from bits and scraps of gossip and neighborhood legend mrs radley had been beautiful until she married mr radley and lost all her money she also lost most of her teeth her hair and her right forefinger dills contribution boo bit it off one night when he couldnt find any cats and squirrels to eat she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time while boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house the three of us were the boys who got into trouble i was the probate judge for a change dill led jem away and crammed him beneath the steps poking him with the brushbroom jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff assorted townsfolk and miss stephanie crawford who had more to say about the radleys than anybody in maycomb when it was time to play boos big scene jem would sneak into the house steal the scissors from the sewingmachine drawer when calpurnias back was turned then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers dill would walk by cough at jem and jem would fake a plunge into dills thigh from where i stood it looked real when mr nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town we would stand still and silent until he was out of sight then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared and once i saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at us her hedge clippers poised in midair one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv book ii of one mans family we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us slapping a rolled magazine against his knee the sun said twelve noon what are you all playing he asked nothing said jem jems evasion told me our game was a secret so i kept quiet what are you doing with those scissors then why are you tearing up that newspaper if its todays ill tan you nothing nothing what said atticus nothing sir give me those scissors atticus said theyre no things to play with does this by any chance have anything to do with the radleys no sir said jem reddening i hope it doesnt he said shortly and went inside the house jem shut up hes gone in the livingroom he can hear us in there safely in the yard dill asked jem if we could play any more i dont know atticus didnt say we couldnt jem i said i think atticus knows it anyway no he dont if he did hed say he did i was not so sure but jem told me i was being a girl that girls always imagined things thats why other people hated them so and if i started behaving like one i could just go off and find some to play with all right you just keep it up then i said youll find out atticuss arrival was the second reason i wanted to quit the game the first reason happened the day i rolled into the radley front yard through all the headshaking quelling of nausea and jemyelling i had heard another sound so low i could not have heard it from the sidewalk someone inside the house was laughing my nagging got the better of jem eventually as i knew it would and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while he still maintained however that atticus hadnt said we couldnt therefore we could and if atticus ever said we couldnt jem had thought of a way around it he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldnt be accused of playing anything dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action dill was becoming something of a trial anyway following jem about he had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him then he promptly forgot about it he staked me out marked as his property said i was the only girl he would ever love then he neglected me i beat him up twice but it did no good he only grew closer to jem they spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning calling me only when they needed a third party but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while and on pain of being called a girl i spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudies yard if we kept out of her azaleas but our contact with her was not clearly defined until jem and dill excluded me from their plans she was only another lady in the neighborhood but a relatively benign presence our tacit treaty with miss maudie was that we could play on her lawn eat her scuppernongs if we didnt jump on the arbor and explore her vast back lot terms so generous we seldom spoke to her so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship but jem and dill drove me closer to her with their behavior miss maudie hated her house time spent indoors was time wasted she was a widow a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and mens coveralls but after her five oclock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty she loved everything that grew in gods earth even the weeds with one exception if she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the second battle of the marne she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful itd kill us all if we didnt stand out of the way why cant you just pull it up i asked after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high pull it up child pull it up she picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk microscopic grains oozed out why one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard look here when it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over maycomb county miss maudies face likened such an occurrence unto an old testament pestilence her speech was crisp for a maycomb county inhabitant she called us by all our names and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth when i admired them and hoped i would have some eventually she said look here with a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship miss maudies benevolence extended to jem and dill whenever they paused in their pursuits we reaped the benefits of a talent miss maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us she made the best cakes in the neighborhood when she was admitted into our confidence every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones and she would call across the street jem finch scout finch charles baker harris come here our promptness was always rewarded in summertime twilights are long and peaceful often as not miss maudie and i would sit silently on her porch watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops miss maudie i said one evening do you think boo radleys still alive his names arthur and hes alive she said she was rocking slowly in her big oak chair do you smell my mimosa its like angels breath this evening yessum how do you know know what child that bmr arthurs still alive what a morbid question but i suppose its a morbid subject i know hes alive jean louise because i havent seen him carried out yet maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney where did you get such a notion thats what jem said he thought they did sssss he gets more like jack finch every day miss maudie had known uncle jack finch atticuss brother since they were children nearly the same age they had grown up together at finchs landing miss maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner dr frank buford dr bufords profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground so he stayed poor uncle jack finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in nashville and stayed rich we saw uncle jack every christmas and every christmas he yelled across the street for miss maudie to come marry him miss maudie would yell back call a little louder jack finch and theyll hear you at the post office i havent heard you yet jem and i thought this a strange way to ask for a ladys hand in marriage but then uncle jack was rather strange he said he was trying to get miss maudies goat that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years that he was the last person in the world miss maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing and the best defense to her was spirited offense all of which we understood clearly arthur radley just stays in the house thats all said miss maudie wouldnt you stay in the house if you didnt want to come out yessum but id wanta come out why doesnt he miss maudies eyes narrowed you know that story as well as i do i never heard why though nobody ever told me why miss maudie settled her bridgework you know old mr radley was a footwashing baptist thats what you are aint it my shells not that hard child im just a baptist dont you all believe in footwashing we do at home in the bathtub but we cant have communion with you all apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion miss maudie said footwashers believe anything thats pleasure is a sin did you know some of em came out of the woods one saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell your flowers too yes maam theyd burn right with me they thought i spent too much time in gods outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the bible my confidence in pulpit gospel lessened at the vision of miss maudie stewing forever in various protestant hells true enough she had an acid tongue in her head and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good as did miss stephanie crawford but while no one with a grain of sense trusted miss stephanie jem and i had considerable faith in miss maudie she had never told on us had never played catandmouse with us she was not at all interested in our private lives she was our friend how so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible that aint right miss maudie youre the best lady i know miss maudie grinned thank you maam thing is footwashers think women are a sin by definition they take the bible literally you know is that why mr arthur stays in the house to keep away from women ive no idea it doesnt make sense to me looks like if mr arthur was hankerin after heaven hed come out on the porch at least atticus says gods loving folks like you love yourself miss maudie stopped rocking and her voice hardened you are too young to understand it she said but sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand ofoh of your father i was shocked atticus doesnt drink whiskey i said he never drunk a drop in his lifenome yes he did he said he drank some one time and didnt like it miss maudie laughed wasnt talking about your father she said what i meant was if atticus finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnt be as hard as some men are at their best there are just some kind of men whowhore so busy worrying about the next world theyve never learned to live in this one and you can look down the street and see the results do you think theyre true all those things they say about bmr arthur what things i told her that is threefourths colored folks and onefourth stephanie crawford said miss maudie grimly stephanie crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her i said what did you do stephanie move over in the bed and make room for him that shut her up a while i was sure it did miss maudies voice was enough to shut anybody up no child she said that is a sad house i remember arthur radley when he was a boy he always spoke nicely to me no matter what folks said he did spoke as nicely as he knew how you reckon hes crazy miss maudie shook her head if hes not he should be by now the things that happen to people we never really know what happens in houses behind closed doors what secrets atticus dont ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he dont do in the yard i said feeling it my duty to defend my parent gracious child i was raveling a thread wasnt even thinking about your father but now that i am ill say this atticus finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets howd you like some fresh poundcake to take home i liked it very much next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in conversation when i joined them as usual they said go away will not this yards as much mine as it is yours jem finch i got just as much right to play in it as you have dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle if you stay youve got to do what we tell you dill warned well i said whos so high and mighty all of a sudden if you dont say youll do what we tell you we aint gonna tell you anything dill continued you act like you grew ten inches in the night all right what is it jem said placidly we are going to give a note to boo radley just how i was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me it was all right for miss maudie to talkshe was old and snug on her porch it was different for us jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters if anyone came along dill would ring the bell dill raised his right hand in it was my mothers silver dinnerbell im goin around to the side of the house said jem we looked yesterday from across the street and theres a shutter loose think maybe i can make it stick on the window sill at least jem now youre in it and you cant get out of it youll just stay in it miss priss okay okay but i dont wanta watch jem somebody was yes you will youll watch the back end of the lot and dills gonna watch the front of the house an up the street an if anybody comes hell ring the bell that clear all right then whatd you write him dill said were askin him real politely to come out sometimes and tell us what he does in therewe said we wouldnt hurt him and wed buy him an ice cream you allve gone crazy hell kill us dill said its my idea i figure if hed come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better how do you know he dont feel good well howd you feel if youd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin but cats to eat i bet hes got a beard down to here like your daddys he aint got a beard he dill stopped as if trying to remember uh huh caughtcha i said you said fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard if its all the same to you he shaved it off last summer yeah an ive got the letter to prove ithe sent me two dollars too keep oni reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform thatn never showed up did it you just keep on tellin em son dill harris could tell the biggest ones i ever heard among other things he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times he had been to nova scotia he had seen an elephant and his granddaddy was brigadier general joe wheeler and left him his sword you all hush said jem he scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk anybody whos brave enough to go up and touch the house hadnt oughta use a fishin pole i said why dont you just knock the front door down thisisdifferent said jem how many times do i have to tell you that dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to jem the three of us walked cautiously toward the old house dill remained at the lightpole on the front corner of the lot and jem and i edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house i walked beyond jem and stood where i could see around the curve all clear i said not a soul in sight jem looked up the sidewalk to dill who nodded jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected the pole lacked several inches of being long enough and jem leaned over as far as he could i watched him making jabbing motions for so long i abandoned my post and went to him cant get it off the pole he muttered or if i got it off i cant make it stay gon back down the street scout i returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road occasionally i looked back at jem who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill it would flutter to the ground and jem would jab it up until i thought if boo radley ever received it he wouldnt be able to read it i was looking down the street when the dinnerbell rang shoulder up i reeled around to face boo radley and his bloody fangs instead i saw dill ringing the bell with all his might in atticuss face jem looked so awful i didnt have the heart to tell him i told him so he trudged along dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk atticus said stop ringing that bell dill grabbed the clapper in the silence that followed i wished hed start ringing it again atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips jem he said what were you doing nothin sir i dont want any of that tell me i waswe were just tryin to give somethin to mr radley what were you trying to give him just a letter let me see it jem held out a filthy piece of paper atticus took it and tried to read it why do you want mr radley to come out dill said we thought he might enjoy us and dried up when atticus looked at him son he said to jem im going to tell you something and tell you one time stop tormenting that man that goes for the other two of you what mr radley did was his own business if he wanted to come out he would if he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children which was a mild term for the likes of us how would we like it if atticus barged in on us without knocking when we were in our rooms at night we were in effect doing the same thing to mr radley what mr radley did might seem peculiar to us but it did not seem peculiar to him furthermore had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window lastly we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town we werent makin fun of him we werent laughin at him said jem we were just so that was what you were doing wasnt it makin fun of him no said atticus putting his lifes history on display for the edification of the neighborhood jem seemed to swell a little i didnt say we were doin that i didnt say it atticus grinned dryly you just told me he said you stop this nonsense right now every one of you jem gaped at him you want to be a lawyer dont you our fathers mouth was suspiciously firm as if he were trying to hold it in line jem decided there was no point in quibbling and was silent when atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyers trick on record he waited a respectful distance from the front steps watched atticus leave the house and walk toward town when atticus was out of earshot jem yelled after him i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i aint so sure now yes said our father when jem asked him if we could go over and sit by miss rachels fishpool with dill as this was his last night in maycomb tell him so long for me and well see him next summer we leaped over the low wall that separated miss rachels yard from our driveway jem whistled bobwhite and dill answered in the darkness not a breath blowing said jem looka yonder he pointed to the east a gigantic moon was rising behind miss maudies pecan trees that makes it seem hotter he said cross in it tonight asked dill not looking up he was constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string no just the lady dont light that thing dill youll stink up this whole end of town there was a lady in the moon in maycomb she sat at a dresser combing her hair were gonna miss you boy i said reckon we better watch for mr avery mr avery boarded across the street from mrs henry lafayette duboses house besides making change in the collection plate every sunday mr avery sat on the porch every night until nine oclock and sneezed one evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last for he never did it again so long as we watched jem and i were leaving miss rachels front steps one night when dill stopped us golly looka yonder he pointed across the street at first we saw nothing but a kudzucovered front porch but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light some ten feet from source to earth it seemed to us jem said mr avery misfigured dill said he must drink a gallon a day and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again as i was untalented in this area dill stretched yawned and said altogether too casually i know what lets go for a walk he sounded fishy to me nobody in maycomb just went for a walk where to dill dill jerked his head in a southerly direction jem said okay when i protested he said sweetly you dont have to come along angel may you dont have to go remember jem was not one to dwell on past defeats it seemed the only message he got from atticus was insight into the art of cross examination scout we aint gonna do anything were just goin to the street light and back we strolled silently down the sidewalk listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood listening to the soft nightmurmurs of the grown people on our street occasionally we heard miss stephanie crawford laugh well said dill okay said jem why dont you go on home scout what are you gonna do dill and jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at boo radley and if i didnt want to go with them i could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut that was all but what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight because nobody could see them at night because atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldnt hear the kingdom coming because if boo radley killed them theyd miss school instead of vacation and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime did i understand jem please scout im tellin you for the last time shut your trap or go home i declare to the lord youre gettin more like a girl every day with that i had no option but to join them we thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the radley lot we stood less chance of being seen the fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse jem held up the bottom wire and motioned dill under it i followed and held up the wire for jem it was a tight squeeze for him dont make a sound he whispered dont get in a row of collards whatever you do theyll wake the dead with this thought in mind i made perhaps one step per minute i moved faster when i saw jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight we came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard jem touched it the gate squeaked spit on it whispered dill youve got us in a box jem i muttered we cant get out of here so easy shh spit on it scout we spat ourselves dry and jem opened the gate slowly lifting it aside and resting it on the fence we were in the back yard the back of the radley house was less inviting than the front a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors instead of a column a rough twobyfour supported one end of the roof an old franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch above it a hatrack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily arr said jem softly lifting his foot smatter chickens he breathed that we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when dill ahead of us spelled god in a whisper we crept to the side of the house around to the window with the hanging shutter the sill was several inches taller than jem give you a hand up he muttered to dill wait though jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist i grabbed my left wrist and jems right wrist we crouched and dill sat on our saddle we raised him and he caught the window sill hurry jem whispered we cant last much longer dill punched my shoulder and we lowered him to the ground whatd you see nothing curtains theres a little teeny light way off somewhere though lets get away from here breathed jem lets go round in back again shh he warned me as i was about to protest lets try the back window dill no i said dill stopped and let jem go ahead when jem put his foot on the bottom step the step squeaked he stood still then tried his weight by degrees the step was silent jem skipped two steps put his foot on the porch heaved himself to it and teetered a long moment he regained his balance and dropped to his knees he crawled to the window raised his head and looked in then i saw the shadow it was the shadow of a man with a hat on at first i thought it was a tree but there was no wind blowing and treetrunks never walked the back porch was bathed in moonlight and the shadow crisp as toast moved across the porch toward jem dill saw it next he put his hands to his face when it crossed jem jem saw it he put his arms over his head and went rigid the shadow stopped about a foot beyond jem its arm came out from its side dropped and was still then it turned and moved back across jem walked along the porch and off the side of the house returning as it had come jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us he flung open the gate danced dill and me through and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards halfway through the collards i tripped as i tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood dill and jem dived beside me jems breath came in sobs fence by the schoolyardhurry scout jem held the bottom wire dill and i rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyards solitary oak when we sensed that jem was not with us we ran back and found him struggling in the fence kicking his pants off to get loose he ran to the oak tree in his shorts safely behind it we gave way to numbness but jems mind was racing we gotta get home theyll miss us we ran across the schoolyard crawled under the fence to deers pasture behind our house climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before jem would let us pause to rest respiration normal the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard we looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the radley front gate we better go down there said jem theyll think its funny if we dont show up mr nathan radley was standing inside his gate a shotgun broken across his arm atticus was standing beside miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford miss rachel and mr avery were near by none of them saw us come up we eased in beside miss maudie who looked around where were you all didnt you hear the commotion what happened asked jem mr radley shot at a negro in his collard patch oh did he hit him no said miss stephanie shot in the air scared him pale though says if anybody sees a white nigger around thats the one says hes got the other barrel waitin for the next sound he hears in that patch an next time he wont aim high be it dog nigger orjem finch maam asked jem atticus spoke wherere your pants son pants sir pants it was no use in his shorts before god and everybody i sighed ahmr finch in the glare from the streetlight i could see dill hatching one his eyes widened his fat cherub face grew rounder what is it dill asked atticus ahi won em from him he said vaguely won them how dills hand sought the back of his head he brought it forward and across his forehead we were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool he said jem and i relaxed the neighbors seemed satisfied they all stiffened but what was strip poker we had no chance to find out miss rachel went off like the town fire siren dooo jeesus dill harris gamblin by my fishpool ill strippoker you sir atticus saved dill from immediate dismemberment just a minute miss rachel he said ive never heard of em doing that before were you all playing cards jem fielded dills fly with his eyes shut no sir just with matches i admired my brother matches were dangerous but cards were fatal jem scout said atticus i dont want to hear of poker in any form again go by dills and get your pants jem settle it yourselves dont worry dill said jem as we trotted up the sidewalk she aint gonna get you hell talk her out of it that was fast thinkin son listen you hear we stopped and heard atticuss voice not serious they all go through it miss rachel dill was comforted but jem and i werent there was the problem of jem showing up some pants in the morning d give you some of mine said dill as we came to miss rachels steps jem said he couldnt get in them but thanks anyway we said goodbye and dill went inside the house he evidently remembered he was engaged to me for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of jem yawl write hear he bawled after us had jems pants been safely on him we would not have slept much anyway every nightsound i heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified threefold every scratch of feet on gravel was boo radley seeking revenge every passing negro laughing in the night was boo radley loose and after us insects splashing against the screen were boo radleys insane fingers picking the wire to pieces the chinaberry trees were malignant hovering alive i lingered between sleep and wakefulness until i heard jem murmur sleep little threeeyes are you crazy shh atticuss lights out in the waning moonlight i saw jem swing his feet to the floor im goin after em he said i sat upright you cant i wont let you he was struggling into his shirt ive got to you do an ill wake up atticus you do and ill kill you i pulled him down beside me on the cot i tried to reason with him mr nathans gonna find em in the morning jem he knows you lost em when he shows em to atticus itll be pretty bad thats all there is to it gon back to bed thats what i know said jem thats why im goin after em i began to feel sick going back to that place by himselfi remembered miss stephanie mr nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard be it nigger dog jem knew that better than i i was desperate look it aint worth it jem a lickin hurts but it doesnt last youll get your head shot off jem please he blew out his breath patiently iits like this scout he muttered atticus aint ever whipped me since i can remember i wanta keep it that way this was a thought it seemed that atticus threatened us every other day you mean hes never caught you at anything maybe so buti just wanta keep it that way scout we shouldna done that tonight scout it was then i suppose that jem and i first began to part company sometimes i did not understand him but my periods of bewilderment were shortlived this was beyond me please i pleaded cantcha just think about it for a minuteby yourself on that place shut up its not like hed never speak to you again or somethin im gonna wake him up jem i swear i am jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight then im goin with you i choked no you aint youll just make noise it was no use i unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps it must have been two oclock the moon was setting and the latticework shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness jems white shirttail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning a faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides he went the back way through deers pasture across the schoolyard and around to the fence i thoughtat least that was the way he was headed it would take longer so it was not time to worry yet i waited until it was time to worry and listened for mr radleys shotgun then i thought i heard the back fence squeak it was wishful thinking then i heard atticus cough i held my breath sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading he said he often woke up during the night checked on us and read himself back to sleep i waited for his light to go on straining my eyes to see it flood the hall it stayed off and i breathed again the nightcrawlers had retired but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs there he was returning to me his white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger he came up the back steps latched the door behind him and sat on his cot wordlessly he held up his pants he lay down and for a while i heard his cot trembling soon he was still i did not hear him stir again jem stayed moody and silent for a week as atticus had once advised me to do i tried to climb into jems skin and walk around in it if i had gone alone to the radley place at two in the morning my funeral would have been held the next afternoon so i left jem alone and tried not to bother him school started the second grade was as bad as the first only worsethey still flashed cards at you and wouldnt let you read or write miss carolines progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter however the usual crew had flunked the first grade again and were helpful in keeping order the only thing good about the second grade was that this year i had to stay as late as jem and we usually walked home together at three oclock one afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home jem suddenly said theres something i didnt tell you as this was his first complete sentence in several days i encouraged him about what about that night youve never told me anything about that night i said jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats he was silent for a while then he said when i went back for my breechesthey were all in a tangle when i was gettin out of em i couldnt get em loose when i went back jem took a deep breath when i went back they were folded across the fence like they were expectin me across and something else jems voice was flat show you when we get home theyd been sewed up not like a lady sewed em like somethin id try to do all crooked its almost like somebody knew you were comin back for em jem shuddered like somebody was readin my mind like somebody could tell what i was gonna do cant anybody tell what im gonna do lest they know me can they scout jems question was an appeal i reassured him cant anybody tell what youre gonna do lest they live in the house with you and even i cant tell sometimes we were walking past our tree in its knothole rested a ball of gray twine dont take it jem i said this is somebodys hidin place i dont think so scout yes it is somebody like walter cunningham comes down here every recess and hides his thingsand we come along and take em away from him listen lets leave it and wait a couple of days if it aint gone then well take it okay okay you might be right said jem it must be some little kids placehides his things from the bigger folks you know its only when schools in that weve found things yeah i said but we never go by here in the summertime we went home next morning the twine was where we had left it when it was still there on the third day jem pocketed it from then on we considered everything we found in the knothole our property the second grade was grim but jem assured me that the older i got the better school would be that he started off the same way and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value the sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning he went through a brief egyptian period that baffled mehe tried to walk flat a great deal sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him putting one foot behind the other he declared egyptians walked that way i said if they did i didnt see how they got anything done but jem said they accomplished more than the americans ever did they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming and asked where would we be today if they hadnt atticus told me to delete the adjectives and id have the facts there are no clearly defined seasons in south alabama summer drifts into autumn and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter but turns to a daysold spring that melts into summer again that fall was a long one hardly cool enough for a light jacket jem and i were trotting in our orbit one mild october afternoon when our knothole stopped us again something white was inside this time jem let me do the honors i pulled out two small images carved in soap one was the figure of a boy the other wore a crude dress before i remembered that there was no such thing as hoodooing i shrieked and threw them down jem snatched them up whats the matter with you he yelled he rubbed the figures free of red dust these are good he said ive never seen any these good he held them down to me they were almost perfect miniatures of two children the boy had on shorts and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows i looked up at jem a point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part i had never noticed it before jem looked from the girldoll to me the girldoll wore bangs so did i these are us he said who did em you reckon who do we know around here who whittles he asked mr avery mr avery just does like this i mean carves mr avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it theres old miss stephanie crawfords sweetheart i said he carves all right but he lives down the country when would he ever pay any attention to us maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of miss stephanie if i was him i would jem stared at me so long i asked what was the matter but got nothing scout for an answer when we went home jem put the dolls in his trunk less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum which we enjoyed the fact that everything on the radley place was poison having slipped jems memory the following week the knothole yielded a tarnished medal jem showed it to atticus who said it was a spelling medal that before we were born the maycomb county schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners atticus said someone must have lost it and had we asked around jem camelkicked me when i tried to say where we had found it jem asked atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one and atticus said no our biggest prize appeared four days later it was a pocket watch that wouldnt run on a chain with an aluminum knife you reckon its white gold jem dont know ill show it to atticus atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars knife chain and all if it were new did you swap with somebody at school he asked oh no sir jem pulled out his grandfathers watch that atticus let him carry once a week if jem were careful with it on the days he carried the watch jem walked on eggs atticus if its all right with you id rather have this one instead maybe i can fix it when the new wore off his grandfathers watch and carrying it became a days burdensome task jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes he did a fair job only one spring and two tiny pieces left over but the watch would not run ohh he sighed itll never go scout huh you reckon we oughta write a letter to whoevers leaving us these things thatd be right nice jem we can thank emwhats wrong jem was holding his ears shaking his head from side to side i dont get it i just dont get iti dont know why scout he looked toward the livingroom ive gotta good mind to tell atticusno i reckon not ill tell him for you no dont do that scout scout what he had been on the verge of telling me something all evening his face would brighten and he would lean toward me then he would change his mind he changed it again oh nothin here lets write a letter i pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose okay dear mister how do you know its a man i bet its miss maudiebeen bettin that for a long time arr miss maudie cant chew gum jem broke into a grin you know she can talk real pretty sometimes one time i asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks thatchewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless said jem carefully doesnt that sound nice yeah she can say nice things sometimes she wouldnt have a watch and chain anyway dear sir said jem we appreciate theno we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for us yours very truly jeremy atticus finch he wont know who you are if you sign it like that jem jem erased his name and wrote jem finch i signed jean louise finch scout beneath it jem put the note in an envelope next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree jem was facing me when he looked up and i saw him go stark white scout i ran to him someone had filled our knothole with cement dont you cry now scout dont cry now dont you worry he muttered at me all the way to school when we went home for dinner jem bolted his food ran to the porch and stood on the steps i followed him hasnt passed by yet he said next day jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded hidy do mr nathan he said morning jem scout said mr radley as he went by mr radley said jem mr radley turned around mr radley ahdid you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder yes he said i filled it up whyd you do it sir trees dying you plug em with cement when theyre sick you ought to know that jem jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon when we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement and remained deep in thought he seemed to be working himself into a bad humor so i kept my distance as usual we met atticus coming home from work that evening when we were at our steps jem said atticus look down yonder at that tree please sir what tree son the one on the corner of the radley lot comin from school yes is that tree dyin why no son i dont think so look at the leaves theyre all green and full no brown patches anywhere it aint even sick that trees as healthy as you are jem why mr nathan radley said it was dyin well maybe it is im sure mr radley knows more about his trees than we do atticus left us on the porch jem leaned on a pillar rubbing his shoulders against it do you itch jem i asked as politely as i could he did not answer come on in jem i said after while he stood there until nightfall and i waited for him when we went in the house i saw he had been crying his face was dirty in the right places but i thought it odd that i had not heard him for reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in maycomb county autumn turned to winter that year we had two weeks of the coldest weather since atticus said mr avery said it was written on the rosetta stone that when children disobeyed their parents smoked cigarettes and made war on each other the seasons would change jem and i were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves old mrs radley died that winter but her death caused hardly a ripplethe neighborhood seldom saw her except when she watered her cannas jem and i decided that boo had got her at last but when atticus returned from the radley house he said she died of natural causes to our disappointment ask him jem whispered you ask him youre the oldest thats why you oughta ask him atticus i said did you see mr arthur atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me i did not jem restrained me from further questions he said atticus was still touchous about us and the radleys and it wouldnt do to push him any jem had a notion that atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker jem had no firm basis for his ideas he said it was merely a twitch next morning i awoke looked out the window and nearly died of fright my screams brought atticus from his bathroom halfshaven the worlds endin atticus please do something i dragged him to the window and pointed no its not he said its snowing jem asked atticus would it keep up jem had never seen snow either but he knew what it was atticus said he didnt know any more about snow than jem did i think though if its watery like that itll turn to rain the telephone rang and atticus left the breakfast table to answer it that was eula may he said when he returned i quoteas it has not snowed in maycomb county since there will be no school today eula may was maycombs leading telephone operator she was entrusted with issuing public announcements wedding invitations setting off the fire siren and giving firstaid instructions when dr reynolds was away when atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of out the windows jem asked how do you make a snowman i havent the slightest idea said atticus i dont want you all to be disappointed but i doubt if therell be enough snow for a snowball even calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking when we ran to the back yard it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow we shouldnt walk about in it said jem look every step you takes wasting it i looked back at my mushy footprints jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman i stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake it burned jem its hot no it aint its so cold it burns now dont eat it scout youre wasting it let it come down but i want to walk in it i know what we can go walk over at miss maudies jem hopped across the front yard i followed in his tracks when we were on the sidewalk in front of miss maudies mr avery accosted us he had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt see what youve done he said hasnt snowed in maycomb since appomattox its bad children like you makes the seasons change i wondered if mr avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance and reflected that if this was our reward there was something to say for sin i did not wonder where mr avery gathered his meteorological statistics they came straight from the rosetta stone jem finch you jem finch miss maudies callin you jem you all stay in the middle of the yard theres some thrift buried under the snow near the porch dont step on it yessum called jem its beautiful aint it miss maudie beautiful my hind foot if it freezes tonight itll carry off all my azaleas miss maudies old sunhat glistened with snow crystals she was bending over some small bushes wrapping them in burlap bags jem asked her what she was doing that for keep em warm she said how can flowers keep warm they dont circulate i cannot answer that question jem finch all i know is if it freezes tonight these plantsll freeze so you cover em up is that clear yessum miss maudie what sir could scout and me borrow some of your snow heavens alive take it all theres an old peach basket under the house haul it off in that miss maudies eyes narrowed jem finch what are you going to do with my snow youll see said jem and we transferred as much snow as we could from miss maudies yard to ours a slushy operation what are we gonna do jem i asked youll see he said now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front walk back in your tracks though he cautioned are we gonna have a snow baby jem no a real snowman gotta work hard now jem ran to the back yard produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile placing any worms he found to one side he went in the house returned with the laundry hamper filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard when we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow jem said we were ready to begin dont you think this is kind of a mess i asked looks messy now but it wont later he said jem scooped up an armful of dirt patted it into a mound on which he added another load and another until he had constructed a torso jem i aint ever heard of a nigger snowman i said he wont be black long he grunted jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard plaited them and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt he looks like stephanie crawford with her hands on her hips i said fat in the middle and littlebitty arms ill make em bigger jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt he looked thoughtfully at it for a moment then he molded a big stomach below the figures waistline jem glanced at me his eyes twinkling mr averys sort of shaped like a snowman aint he jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on he permitted me to cover only the back saving the public parts for himself gradually mr avery turned white using bits of wood for eyes nose mouth and buttons jem succeeded in making mr avery look cross a stick of stovewood completed the picture jem stepped back and viewed his creation its lovely jem i said looks almost like hed talk to you it is aint it he said shyly we could not wait for atticus to come home for dinner but called and said we had a big surprise for him he seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard but he said we had done a jimdandy job i didnt know how you were going to do it he said to jem but from now on ill never worry about whatll become of you son youll always have an idea jems ears reddened from atticuss compliment but he looked up sharply when he saw atticus stepping back atticus squinted at the snowman a while he grinned then laughed son i cant tell what youre going to bean engineer a lawyer or a portrait painter youve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard weve got to disguise this fellow atticus suggested that jem hone down his creations front a little swap a broom for the stovewood and put an apron on him jem explained that if he did the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman i dont care what you do so long as you do something said atticus you cant go around making caricatures of the neighbors aint a characterture said jem it looks just like him mr avery might not think so i know what said jem he raced across the street disappeared into miss maudies back yard and returned triumphant he stuck her sunhat on the snowmans head and jammed her hedgeclippers into the crook of his arm atticus said that would be fine miss maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch she looked across the street at us suddenly she grinned jem finch she called you devil bring me back my hat sir jem looked up at atticus who shook his head shes just fussing he said shes really impressed with youraccomplishments atticus strolled over to miss maudies sidewalk where they engaged in an armwaving conversation the only phrase of which i caught was erected an absolute morphodite in that yard atticus youll never raise em the snow stopped in the afternoon the temperature dropped and by nightfall mr averys direst predictions came true calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing but we were cold when atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it and asked calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought shed be warmer at her house atticus drove her home in the car before i went to sleep atticus put more coal on the fire in my room he said the thermometer registered sixteen that it was the coldest night in his memory and that our snowman outside was frozen solid minutes later it seemed i was awakened by someone shaking me atticuss overcoat was spread across me is it morning already baby get up atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat put your robe on first he said jem was standing beside atticus groggy and tousled he was holding his overcoat closed at the neck his other hand was jammed into his pocket he looked strangely overweight hurry hon said atticus herere your shoes and socks stupidly i put them on is it morning no its a little after one hurry now that something was wrong finally got through to me whats the matter by then he did not have to tell me just as the birds know where to go when it rains i knew when there was trouble in our street soft taffetalike sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread whose is it miss maudies hon said atticus gently at the front door we saw fire spewing from miss maudies diningroom windows as if to confirm what we saw the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there screaming its gone aint it moaned jem i expect so said atticus now listen both of you go down and stand in front of the radley place keep out of the way do you hear see which way the winds blowing oh said jem atticus reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out not yet son do as i tell you run now take care of scout you hear dont let her out of your sight with a push atticus started us toward the radley front gate we stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured miss maudies house why dont they hurry why dont they hurry muttered jem we saw why the old fire truck killed by the cold was being pushed from town by a crowd of men when the men attached its hose to a hydrant the hose burst and water shot up tinkling down on the pavement ohh lord jem jem put his arm around me hush scout he said it aint time to worry yet ill let you know when the men of maycomb in all degrees of dress and undress took furniture from miss maudies house to a yard across the street i saw atticus carrying miss maudies heavy oak rocking chair and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most sometimes we heard shouts then mr averys face appeared in an upstairs window he pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted come down from there dick the stairs are going get outta there mr avery mr avery began climbing through the window scout hes stuck breathed jem oh god mr avery was wedged tightly i buried my head under jems arm and didnt look again until jem cried hes got loose scout hes all right i looked up to see mr avery cross the upstairs porch he swung his legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped he fell yelled and hit miss maudies shrubbery suddenly i noticed that the men were backing away from miss maudies house moving down the street toward us they were no longer carrying furniture the fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof window frames were black against a vivid orange center jem it looks like a pumpkin scout look smoke was rolling off our house and miss rachels house like fog off a riverbank and men were pulling hoses toward them behind us the fire truck from abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house that book i said what said jem that tom swift book it aint mine its dills dont worry scout it aint time to worry yet said jem he pointed looka yonder in a group of neighbors atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets he might have been watching a football game miss maudie was beside him see there hes not worried yet said jem why aint he on top of one of the houses hes too old hed break his neck you think we oughta make him get our stuff out lets dont pester him hell know when its time said jem the abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house a man on the roof pointed to places that needed it most i watched our absolute morphodite go black and crumble miss maudies sunhat settled on top of the heap i could not see her hedgeclippers in the heat between our house miss rachels and miss maudies the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes they worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants but i became aware that i was slowly freezing where i stood jem tried to keep me warm but his arm was not enough i pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders by dancing a little i could feel my feet another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of miss stephanie crawfords there was no hydrant for another hose and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguishers miss maudies tin roof quelled the flames roaring the house collapsed fire gushed everywhere followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood it was dawn before the men began to leave first one by one then in groups they pushed the maycomb fire truck back to town the abbottsville truck departed the third one remained we found out next day it had come from clarks ferry sixty miles away jem and i slid across the street miss maudie was staring at the smoking black hole in her yard and atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk he led us home holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street he said miss maudie would stay with miss stephanie for the time being anybody want some hot chocolate he asked i shuddered when atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove as we drank our cocoa i noticed atticus looking at me first with curiosity then with sternness i thought i told you and jem to stay put he said why we did we stayed then whose blanket is that blanket yes maam blanket it isnt ours i looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket i was wearing around my shoulders squawfashion atticus i dont know sir i i turned to jem for an answer but jem was even more bewildered than i he said he didnt know how it got there we did exactly as atticus had told us we stood down by the radley gate away from everybody we didnt move an inchjem stopped mr nathan was at the fire he babbled i saw him i saw him he was tuggin that mattressatticus i swear thats all right son atticus grinned slowly looks like all of maycomb was out tonight in one way or another jem theres some wrapping paper in the pantry i think go get it and well atticus no sir jem seemed to have lost his mind he began pouring out our secrets right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own omitting nothing knothole pants and all mr nathan put cement in that tree atticus an he did it to stop us findin thingshes crazy i reckon like they say but atticus i swear to god he aint ever harmed us he aint ever hurt us he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants instead he aint ever hurt us atticus atticus said whoa son so gently that i was greatly heartened it was obvious that he had not followed a word jem said for all atticus said was youre right wed better keep this and the blanket to ourselves someday maybe scout can thank him for covering her up thank who i asked boo radley you were so busy looking at the fire you didnt know it when he put the blanket around you my stomach turned to water and i nearly threw up when jem held out the blanket and crept toward me he sneaked out of the house turn roundsneaked up an went like this atticus said dryly do not let this inspire you to further glory jeremy jem scowled i aint gonna do anything to him but i watched the spark of fresh adventure leave his eyes just think scout he said if youd just turned around youda seen him calpurnia woke us at noon atticus had said we need not go to school that day wed learn nothing after no sleep calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard miss maudies sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice like a fly in amber and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedgeclippers we found her in her back yard gazing at her frozen charred azaleas were bringing back your things miss maudie said jem were awful sorry miss maudie looked around and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face always wanted a smaller house jem finch gives me more yard just think ill have more room for my azaleas now you aint grievin miss maudie i asked surprised atticus said her house was nearly all she had grieving child why i hated that old cow barn thought of settin fire to it a hundred times myself except theyd lock me up but dont you worry about me jean louise finch there are ways of doing things you dont know about why ill build me a little house and take me a couple of roomers andgracious ill have the finest yard in alabama those bellingrathsll look plain puny when i get started jem and i looked at each other howd it catch miss maudie he asked i dont know jem probably the flue in the kitchen i kept a fire in there last night for my potted plants hear you had some unexpected company last night miss jean louise howd you know atticus told me on his way to town this morning tell you the truth id like tove been with you and idve had sense enough to turn around too miss maudie puzzled me with most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard a shambles she still took a lively and cordial interest in jems and my affairs she must have seen my perplexity she said only thing i worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused this whole neighborhood could have gone up mr averyll be in bed for a weekhes right stove up hes too old to do things like that and i told him so soon as i can get my hands clean and when stephanie crawfords not looking ill make him a lane cake that stephanies been after my recipe for thirty years and if she thinks ill give it to her just because im staying with her shes got another think coming i reflected that if miss maudie broke down and gave it to her miss stephanie couldnt follow it anyway miss maudie had once let me see it among other things the recipe called for one large cup of sugar it was a still day the air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank rattle and strain before it struck the hour miss maudies nose was a color i had never seen before and i inquired about it ive been out here since six oclock she said should be frozen by now she held up her hands a network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms brown with dirt and dried blood youve ruined em said jem why dont you get a colored man there was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added or scoutnme we can help you miss maudie said thank you sir but youve got a job of your own over there she pointed to our yard you mean the morphodite i asked shoot we can rake him up in a jiffy miss maudie stared down at me her lips moving silently suddenly she put her hands to her head and whooped when we left her she was still chuckling jem said he didnt know what was the matter with herthat was just miss maudie you can just take that back boy this order given by me to cecil jacobs was the beginning of a rather thin time for jem and me my fists were clenched and i was ready to let fly atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more i was far too old and too big for such childish things and the sooner i learned to hold in the better off everybody would be i soon forgot cecil jacobs made me forget he had announced in the schoolyard the day before that scout finchs daddy defended niggers i denied it but told jem whatd he mean sayin that i asked nothing jem said ask atticus hell tell you do you defend niggers atticus i asked him that evening of course i do dont say nigger scout thats common s what everybody at school says from now on itll be everybody less one well if you dont want me to grow up talkin that way why do you send me to school my father looked at me mildly amusement in his eyes despite our compromise my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first days dose of it the beginning of last september had brought on sinking spells dizziness and mild gastric complaints i went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of miss rachels cooks son who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm it didnt take but i was worrying another bone do all lawyers defend nnegroes atticus of course they do scout then why did cecil say you defended niggers he made it sound like you were runnin a still atticus sighed im simply defending a negrohis names tom robinson he lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump hes a member of calpurnias church and cal knows his family well she says theyre cleanliving folks scout you arent old enough to understand some things yet but theres been some high talk around town to the effect that i shouldnt do much about defending this man its a peculiar caseit wont come to trial until summer session john taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement if you shouldnt be defendin him then why are you doin it for a number of reasons said atticus the main one is if i didnt i couldnt hold up my head in town i couldnt represent this county in the legislature i couldnt even tell you or jem not to do something again you mean if you didnt defend that man jem and me wouldnt have to mind you any more thats about right why because i could never ask you to mind me again scout simply by the nature of the work every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally this ones mine i guess you might hear some ugly talk about it at school but do one thing for me if you will you just hold your head high and keep those fists down no matter what anybody says to you dont you let em get your goat try fighting with your head for a change its a good one even if it does resist learning atticus are we going to win it no honey then why simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win atticus said you sound like cousin ike finch i said cousin ike finch was maycomb countys sole surviving confederate veteran he wore a general hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain at least once a year atticus jem and i called on him and i would have to kiss him it was horrible jem and i would listen respectfully to atticus and cousin ike rehash the war tell you atticus cousin ike would say the missouri compromise was what licked us but if i had to go through it agin id walk every step of the way there an every step back jist like i did before an furthermore wed whip em this time now in when stonewall jackson came around byi beg your pardon young folks ol blue light was in heaven then god rest his saintly brow come here scout said atticus i crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin he put his arms around me and rocked me gently its different this time he said this time we arent fighting the yankees were fighting our friends but remember this no matter how bitter things get theyre still our friends and this is still our home with this in mind i faced cecil jacobs in the schoolyard next day you gonna take that back boy you gotta make me first he yelled my folks said your daddy was a disgrace an that nigger oughta hang from the watertank i drew a bead on him remembered what atticus had said then dropped my fists and walked away scouts a cowward ringing in my ears it was the first time i ever walked away from a fight somehow if i fought cecil i would let atticus down atticus so rarely asked jem and me to do something for him i could take being called a coward for him i felt extremely noble for having remembered and remained noble for three weeks then christmas came and disaster struck jem and i viewed christmas with mixed feelings the good side was the tree and uncle jack finch every christmas eve day we met uncle jack at maycomb junction and he would spend a week with us a flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of aunt alexandra and francis i suppose i should include uncle jimmy aunt alexandras husband but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say get off the fence once i never saw any reason to take notice of him neither did aunt alexandra long ago in a burst of friendliness aunty and uncle jimmy produced a son named henry who left home as soon as was humanly possible married and produced francis henry and his wife deposited francis at his grandparents every christmas then pursued their own pleasures no amount of sighing could induce atticus to let us spend christmas day at home we went to finchs landing every christmas in my memory the fact that aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with francis hancock he was a year older than i and i avoided him on principle he enjoyed everything i disapproved of and disliked my ingenuous diversions aunt alexandra was atticuss sister but when jem told me about changelings and siblings i decided that she had been swapped at birth that my grandparents had perhaps received a crawford instead of a finch had i ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges aunt alexandra would have been analogous to mount everest throughout my early life she was cold and there when uncle jack jumped down from the train christmas eve day we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages jem and i always thought it funny when uncle jack pecked atticus on the cheek they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other uncle jack shook hands with jem and swung me high but not high enough uncle jack was a head shorter than atticus the baby of the family he was younger than aunt alexandra he and aunty looked alike but uncle jack made better use of his face we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin he was one of the few men of science who never terrified me probably because he never behaved like a doctor whenever he performed a minor service for jem and me as removing a splinter from a foot he would tell us exactly what he was going to do give us an estimation of how much it would hurt and explain the use of any tongs he employed one christmas i lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot permitting no one to come near me when uncle jack caught me he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressinggown smoking a hookah and delivering fiveminute sermons to any passersby who desired spiritual comfort i interrupted to make uncle jack let me know when he would pull it out but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while i was laughing that was what was known as relativity whats in those packages i asked him pointing to the long thin parcels the porter had given him none of your business he said jem said hows rose aylmer rose aylmer was uncle jacks cat she was a beautiful yellow female uncle jack said was one of the few women he could stand permanently he reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshots we admired them shes gettin fat i said i should think so she eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital aw thats a damn story i said i beg your pardon atticus said dont pay any attention to her jack shes trying you out cal says shes been cussing fluently for a week now uncle jack raised his eyebrows and said nothing i was proceeding on the dim theory aside from the innate attractiveness of such words that if atticus discovered i had picked them up at school he wouldnt make me go but at supper that evening when i asked him to pass the damn ham please uncle jack pointed at me see me afterwards young lady he said when supper was over uncle jack went to the livingroom and sat down he slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap i liked to smell him he was like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet he pushed back my bangs and looked at me youre more like atticus than your mother he said youre also growing out of your pants a little i reckon they fit all right you like words like damn and hell now dont you i said i reckoned so well i dont said uncle jack not unless theres extreme provocation connected with em ill be here a week and i dont want to hear any words like that while im here scout youll get in trouble if you go around saying things like that you want to grow up to be a lady dont you i said not particularly of course you do now lets get to the tree we decorated the tree until bedtime and that night i dreamed of the two long packages for jem and me next morning jem and i dived for them they were from atticus who had written uncle jack to get them for us and they were what we had asked for dont point them in the house said atticus when jem aimed at a picture on the wall youll have to teach em to shoot said uncle jack thats your job said atticus i merely bowed to the inevitable it took atticuss courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree he declined to let us take our air rifles to the landing i had already begun to think of shooting francis and said if we made one false move hed take them away from us for good finchs landing consisted of three hundred and sixtysix steps down a high bluff and ending in a jetty farther down stream beyond the bluff were traces of an old cotton landing where finch negroes had loaded bales and produce unloaded blocks of ice flour and sugar farm equipment and feminine apparel a tworut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees at the end of the road was a twostoried white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs in his old age our ancestor simon finch had built it to please his nagging wife but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended the internal arrangements of the finch house were indicative of simons guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring there were six bedrooms upstairs four for the eight female children one for welcome finch the sole son and one for visiting relatives simple enough but the daughters rooms could be reached only by one staircase welcomes room and the guestroom only by another the daughters staircase was in the groundfloor bedroom of their parents so simon always knew the hours of his daughters nocturnal comings and goings there was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole used to summon field hands or as a distress signal a widows walk was on the roof but no widows walked therefrom it simon oversaw his overseer watched the riverboats and gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders there went with the house the usual legend about the yankees one finch female recently engaged donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the neighborhood she became stuck in the door to the daughters staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed through when we arrived at the landing aunt alexandra kissed uncle jack francis kissed uncle jack uncle jimmy shook hands silently with uncle jack jem and i gave our presents to francis who gave us a present jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults leaving me to entertain our cousin francis was eight and slicked back his hair whatd you get for christmas i asked politely just what i asked for he said francis had requested a pair of kneepants a red leather booksack five shirts and an untied bow tie thats nice i lied jem and me got air rifles and jem got a chemistry set a toy one i reckon no a real one hes gonna make me some invisible ink and im gonna write to dill in it francis asked what was the use of that well cant you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it itll drive him nuts talking to francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean he was the most boring child i ever met as he lived in mobile he could not inform on me to school authorities but he managed to tell everything he knew to aunt alexandra who in turn unburdened herself to atticus who either forgot it or gave me hell whichever struck his fancy but the only time i ever heard atticus speak sharply to anyone was when i once heard him say sister i do the best i can with them it had something to do with my going around in overalls aunt alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire i could not possibly hope to be a lady if i wore breeches when i said i could do nothing in a dress she said i wasnt supposed to be doing things that required pants aunt alexandras vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves tea sets and wearing the addapearl necklace she gave me when i was born furthermore i should be a ray of sunshine in my fathers lonely life i suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well but aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam that i was born good but had grown progressively worse every year she hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge but when i asked atticus about it he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business he didnt mind me much the way i was at christmas dinner i sat at the little table in the diningroom jem and francis sat with the adults at the dining table aunty had continued to isolate me long after jem and francis graduated to the big table i often wondered what she thought id do get up and throw something i sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once i would prove to her how civilized i could be after all i ate at home every day with no major mishaps when i begged atticus to use his influence he said he had nonewe were guests and we sat where she told us to sit he also said aunt alexandra didnt understand girls much shed never had one but her cooking made up for everything three kinds of meat summer vegetables from her pantry shelves peach pickles two kinds of cake and ambrosia constituted a modest christmas dinner afterwards the adults made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition jem lay on the floor and i went to the back yard put on your coat said atticus dreamily so i didnt hear him francis sat beside me on the back steps that was the best yet i said grandmas a wonderful cook said francis shes gonna teach me how boys dont cook i giggled at the thought of jem in an apron grandma says all men should learn to cook that men oughta be careful with their wives and wait on em when they dont feel good said my cousin i dont want dill waitin on me i said id rather wait on him dill yeah dont say anything about it yet but were gonna get married as soon as were big enough he asked me last summer francis hooted whats the matter with him i asked aint anything the matter with him you mean that little runt grandma says stays with miss rachel every summer thats exactly who i mean i know all about him said francis what about him grandma says he hasnt got a home has too he lives in meridian he just gets passed around from relative to relative and miss rachel keeps him every summer francis thats not so francis grinned at me youre mighty dumb sometimes jean louise guess you dont know any better though what do you mean if uncle atticus lets you run around with stray dogs thats his own business like grandma says so it aint your fault i guess it aint your fault if uncle atticus is a niggerlover besides but im here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family francis what the hell do you mean just what i said grandma says its bad enough he lets you all run wild but now hes turned out a niggerlover well never be able to walk the streets of maycomb agin hes ruinin the family thats what hes doin francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen at a safe distance he called hes nothin but a niggerlover he is not i roared i dont know what youre talkin about but you better cut it out this red hot minute i leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk it was easy to collar francis i said take it back quick francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen niggerlover he yelled when stalking ones prey it is best to take ones time say nothing and as sure as eggs he will become curious and emerge francis appeared at the kitchen door you still mad jean louise he asked tentatively nothing to speak of i said francis came out on the catwalk you gonna take it back fraancis but i was too quick on the draw francis shot back into the kitchen so i retired to the steps i could wait patiently i had sat there perhaps five minutes when i heard aunt alexandra speak wheres francis hes out yonder in the kitchen he knows hes not supposed to play in there francis came to the door and yelled grandma shes got me in here and she wont let me out what is all this jean louise i looked up at aunt alexandra i havent got him in there aunty i aint holdin him yes she is shouted francis she wont let me out have you all been fussing jean louise got mad at me grandma called francis francis come out of there jean louise if i hear another word out of you ill tell your father did i hear you say hell a while ago nome i thought i did id better not hear it again aunt alexandra was a backporch listener the moment she was out of sight francis came out head up and grinning dont you fool with me he said he jumped into the yard and kept his distance kicking tufts of grass turning around occasionally to smile at me jem appeared on the porch looked at us and went away francis climbed the mimosa tree came down put his hands in his pockets and strolled around the yard hah he said i asked him who he thought he was uncle jack francis said he reckoned i got told for me to just sit there and leave him alone i aint botherin you i said francis looked at me carefully concluded that i had been sufficiently subdued and crooned softly niggerlover this time i split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth my left impaired i sailed in with my right but not for long uncle jack pinned my arms to my sides and said stand still aunt alexandra ministered to francis wiping his tears away with her handkerchief rubbing his hair patting his cheek atticus jem and uncle jimmy had come to the back porch when francis started yelling who started this said uncle jack francis and i pointed at each other grandma he bawled she called me a whorelady and jumped on me is that true scout said uncle jack i reckon so when uncle jack looked down at me his features were like aunt alexandras you know i told you youd get in trouble if you used words like that i told you didnt i yes sir but well youre in trouble now stay there i was debating whether to stand there or run and tarried in indecision a moment too long i turned to flee but uncle jack was quicker i found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass ill never speak to you again as long as i live i hate you an despise you an hope you die tomorrow a statement that seemed to encourage uncle jack more than anything i ran to atticus for comfort but he said i had it coming and it was high time we went home i climbed into the back seat of the car without saying goodbye to anyone and at home i ran to my room and slammed the door jem tried to say something nice but i wouldnt let him when i surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks and i was reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door i asked who it was uncle jack answered go away uncle jack said if i talked like that hed lick me again so i was quiet when he entered the room i retreated to a corner and turned my back on him scout he said do you still hate me go on please sir why i didnt think youd hold it against me he said im disappointed in youyou had that coming and you know it didnt either honey you cant go around calling people you aint fair i said you aint fair uncle jacks eyebrows went up not fair how not youre real nice uncle jack an i reckon i love you even after what you did but you dont understand children much uncle jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me and why do i not understand children miss jean louise such conduct as yours required little understanding it was obstreperous disorderly and abusive you gonna give me a chance to tell you i dont mean to sass you im just tryin to tell you uncle jack sat down on the bed his eyebrows came together and he peered up at me from under them proceed he said i took a deep breath well in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance to tell you my side of ityou just lit right into me when jem an i fuss atticus doesnt ever just listen to jems side of it he hears mine too an in the second place you told me never to use words like that except in exextreme provocation and francis provocated me enough to knock his block off uncle jack scratched his head what was your side of it scout francis called atticus somethin an i wasnt about to take it off him what did francis call him a niggerlover i aint very sure what it means but the way francis said ittell you one thing right now uncle jack ill bei swear before god if ill sit there and let him say somethin about atticus he called atticus that yes sir he did an a lot more said atticusd be the ruination of the family an he let jem an me run wild from the look on uncle jacks face i thought i was in for it again when he said well see about this i knew francis was in for it ive a good mind to go out there tonight please sir just let it go please ive no intention of letting it go he said alexandra should know about this the idea ofwaitll i get my hands on that boy uncle jack please promise me somethin please sir promise you wont tell atticus about this hehe asked me one time not to let anything i heard about him make me mad an id ruther him think we were fightin about somethin else instead please promise but i dont like francis getting away with something like that he didnt you reckon you could tie up my hand its still bleedin some of course i will baby i know of no hand i would be more delighted to tie up will you come this way uncle jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom while he cleaned and bandaged my knuckles he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named hodge and who counted all the cracks in the sidewalk when he went to town there now he said youll have a very unladylike scar on your weddingring finger thank you sir uncle jack maam whats a whorelady uncle jack plunged into another long tale about an old prime minister who sat in the house of commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there when all about him men were losing their heads i guess he was trying to answer my question but he made no sense whatsoever later when i was supposed to be in bed i went down the hall for a drink of water and heard atticus and uncle jack in the livingroom i shall never marry atticus why i might have children atticus said youve a lot to learn jack i know your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon she said i didnt understand children much and told me why she was quite right atticus she told me how i should have treated heroh dear im so sorry i romped on her atticus chuckled she earned it so dont feel too remorseful i waited on tenterhooks for uncle jack to tell atticus my side of it but he didnt he simply murmured her use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to the imagination but she doesnt know the meaning of half she saysshe asked me what a whorelady was did you tell her no i told her about lord melbourne jack when a child asks you something answer him for goodness sake but dont make a production of it children are children but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults and evasion simply muddles em no my father mused you had the right answer this afternoon but the wrong reasons bad language is a stage all children go through and it dies with time when they learn theyre not attracting attention with it hotheadedness isnt scouts got to learn to keep her head and learn soon with whats in store for her these next few months shes coming along though jems getting older and she follows his example a good bit now all she needs is assistance sometimes atticus youve never laid a hand on her i admit that so far ive been able to get by with threats jack she minds me as well as she can doesnt come up to scratch half the time but she tries thats not the answer said uncle jack no the answer is she knows i know she tries thats what makes the difference what bothers me is that she and jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty soon im not worried about jem keeping his head but scoutd just as soon jump on someone as look at him if her prides at stake i waited for uncle jack to break his promise he still didnt atticus how bad is this going to be you havent had too much chance to discuss it it couldnt be worse jack the only thing weve got is a black mans word against the ewells the evidence boils down to youdidididnt the jury couldnt possibly be expected to take tom robinsons word against the ewellsare you acquainted with the ewells uncle jack said yes he remembered them he described them to atticus but atticus said youre a generation off the present ones are the same though what are you going to do then before im through i intend to jar the jury a biti think well have a reasonable chance on appeal though i really cant tell at this stage jack you know id hoped to get through life without a case of this kind but john taylor pointed at me and said youre it let this cup pass from you eh right but do you think i could face my children otherwise you know whats going to happen as well as i do jack and i hope and pray i can get jem and scout through it without bitterness and most of all without catching maycombs usual disease why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a negro comes up is something i dont pretend to understand i just hope that jem and scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town i hope they trust me enough jean louise my scalp jumped i stuck my head around the corner sir go to bed i scurried to my room and went to bed uncle jack was a prince of a fellow not to let me down but i never figured out how atticus knew i was listening and it was not until many years later that i realized he wanted me to hear every word he said atticus was feeble he was nearly fifty when jem and i asked him why he was so old he said he got started late which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness he was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries and there was nothing jem or i could say about him when our classmates said my father jem was football crazy atticus was never too tired to play keepaway but when jem wanted to tackle him atticus would say im too old for that son our father didnt do anything he worked in an office not in a drugstore atticus did not drive a dumptruck for the county he was not the sheriff he did not farm work in a garage or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone besides that he wore glasses he was nearly blind in his left eye and said left eyes were the tribal curse of the finches whenever he wanted to see something well he turned his head and looked from his right eye he did not do the things our schoolmates fathers did he never went hunting he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke he sat in the livingroom and read with these attributes however he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wished him to that year the school buzzed with talk about him defending tom robinson none of which was complimentary after my bout with cecil jacobs when i committed myself to a policy of cowardice word got around that scout finch wouldnt fight any more her daddy wouldnt let her this was not entirely correct i wouldnt fight publicly for atticus but the family was private ground i would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail francis hancock for example knew that when he gave us our airrifles atticus wouldnt teach us to shoot uncle jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof he said atticus wasnt interested in guns atticus said to jem one day id rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard but i know youll go after birds shoot all the bluejays you want if you can hit em but remember its a sin to kill a mockingbird that was the only time i ever heard atticus say it was a sin to do something and i asked miss maudie about it your fathers right she said mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy they dont eat up peoples gardens dont nest in corncribs they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird miss maudie this is an old neighborhood aint it been here longer than the town nome i mean the folks on our street are all old jem and mes the only children around here mrs dubose is close on to a hundred and miss rachels old and so are you and atticus i dont call fifty very old said miss maudie tartly not being wheeled around yet am i neithers your father but i must say providence was kind enough to burn down that old mausoleum of mine im too old to keep it upmaybe youre right jean louise this is a settled neighborhood youve never been around young folks much have you yessum at school i mean young grownups youre lucky you know you and jem have the benefit of your fathers age if your father was thirty youd find life quite different i sure would atticus cant do anything youd be surprised said miss maudie theres life in him yet what can he do well he can make somebodys will so airtight cant anybody meddle with it shoot well did you know hes the best checkerplayer in this town why down at the landing when we were coming up atticus finch could beat everybody on both sides of the river good lord miss maudie jem and me beat him all the time its about time you found out its because he lets you did you know he can play a jews harp this modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him well she said well what miss maudie well nothing nothingit seems with all that youd be proud of him cant everybody play a jews harp now keep out of the way of the carpenters youd better go home ill be in my azaleas and cant watch you plank might hit you i went to the back yard and found jem plugging away at a tin can which seemed stupid with all the bluejays around i returned to the front yard and busied myself for two hours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch consisting of a tire an orange crate the laundry hamper the porch chairs and a small us flag jem gave me from a popcorn box when atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across the street what are you shooting at miss maudies rear end atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes he pushed his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street maudie he called i thought id better warn you youre in considerable peril miss maudie straightened up and looked toward me she said atticus you are a devil from hell when atticus returned he told me to break camp dont you ever let me catch you pointing that gun at anybody again he said i wished my father was a devil from hell i sounded out calpurnia on the subject mr finch why he can do lots of things like what i asked calpurnia scratched her head well i dont rightly know she said jem underlined it when he asked atticus if he was going out for the methodists and atticus said hed break his neck if he did he was just too old for that sort of thing the methodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage and had challenged the baptists to a game of touch football everybody in towns father was playing it seemed except atticus jem said he didnt even want to go but he was unable to resist football in any form and he stood gloomily on the sidelines with atticus and me watching cecil jacobss father make touchdowns for the baptists one saturday jem and i decided to go exploring with our airrifles to see if we could find a rabbit or a squirrel we had gone about five hundred yards beyond the radley place when i noticed jem squinting at something down the street he had turned his head to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes whatcha looking at that old dog down yonder he said thats old tim johnson aint it yeah tim johnson was the property of mr harry johnson who drove the mobile bus and lived on the southern edge of town tim was a livercolored bird dog the pet of maycomb whats he doing i dont know scout we better go home aw jem its february i dont care im gonna tell cal we raced home and ran to the kitchen cal said jem can you come down the sidewalk a minute what for jem i cant come down the sidewalk every time you want me theres somethin wrong with an old dog down yonder calpurnia sighed i cant wrap up any dogs foot now theres some gauze in the bathroom go get it and do it yourself jem shook his head hes sick cal somethings wrong with him whats he doin trying to catch his tail no hes doin like this jem gulped like a goldfish hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso hes goin like that only not like he means to are you telling me a story jem finch calpurnias voice hardened no cal i swear im not was he runnin no hes just moseyin along so slow you cant hardly tell it hes comin this way calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed jem into the yard i dont see any dog she said she followed us beyond the radley place and looked where jem pointed tim johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance but he was closer to us he walked erratically as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs he reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed hes gone lopsided said jem calpurnia stared then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home she shut the wood door behind us went to the telephone and shouted gimme mr finchs office mr finch she shouted this is cal i swear to god theres a mad dog down the street a piecehes comin this way yes sir hesmr finch i declare he isold tim johnson yes sir yessir yes she hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what atticus had said she rattled the telephone hook and said miss eula maynow maam im through talkin to mr finch please dont connect me no morelisten miss eula may can you call miss rachel and miss stephanie crawford and whoevers got a phone on this street and tell em a mad dogs comin please maam calpurnia listened i know its february miss eula may but i know a mad dog when i see one please maam hurry calpurnia asked jem radleys got a phone jem looked in the book and said no they wont come out anyway cal i dont care im gonna tell em she ran to the front porch jem and i at her heels you stay in that house she yelled calpurnias message had been received by the neighborhood every wood door within our range of vision was closed tight we saw no trace of tim johnson we watched calpurnia running toward the radley place holding her skirt and apron above her knees she went up to the front steps and banged on the door she got no answer and she shouted mr nathan mr arthur mad dogs comin mad dogs comin shes supposed to go around in back i said jem shook his head dont make any difference now he said calpurnia pounded on the door in vain no one acknowledged her warning no one seemed to have heard it as calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black ford swung into the driveway atticus and mr heck tate got out mr heck tate was the sheriff of maycomb county he was as tall as atticus but thinner he was longnosed wore boots with shiny metal eyeholes boot pants and a lumber jacket his belt had a row of bullets sticking in it he carried a heavy rifle when he and atticus reached the porch jem opened the door stay inside son said atticus where is he cal he oughta be here by now said calpurnia pointing down the street not runnin is he asked mr tate naw sir hes in the twitchin stage mr heck should we go after him heck asked atticus we better wait mr finch they usually go in a straight line but you never can tell he might follow the curvehope he does or hell go straight in the radley back yard lets wait a minute dont think hell get in the radley yard said atticus fencell stop him hell probably follow the road i thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth galloped leaped and lunged at throats and i thought they did it in august had tim johnson behaved thus i would have been less frightened nothing is more deadly than a deserted waiting street the trees were still the mockingbirds were silent the carpenters at miss maudies house had vanished i heard mr tate sniff then blow his nose i saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm i saw miss stephanie crawfords face framed in the glass window of her front door miss maudie appeared and stood beside her atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh there he is he said softly tim johnson came into sight walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel to the radley house look at him whispered jem mr heck said they walked in a straight line he cant even stay in the road he looks more sick than anything i said let anything get in front of him and hell come straight at it mr tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward hes got it all right mr finch tim johnson was advancing at a snails pace but he was not playing or sniffing at foliage he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that was inching him toward us we could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies his jaw opened and shut he was alist but he was being pulled gradually toward us hes lookin for a place to die said jem mr tate turned around hes far from dead jem he hasnt got started yet tim johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the radley place and what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he would take he made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the radley gate then he tried to turn around but was having difficulty atticus said hes within range heck you better get him before he goes down the side streetlord knows whos around the corner go inside cal calpurnia opened the screen door latched it behind her then unlatched it and held onto the hook she tried to block jem and me with her body but we looked out from beneath her arms take him mr finch mr tate handed the rifle to atticus jem and i nearly fainted dont waste time heck said atticus go on mr finch this is a oneshot job atticus shook his head vehemently dont just stand there heck he wont wait all day for you for gods sake mr finch look where he is miss and youll go straight into the radley house i cant shoot that well and you know it i havent shot a gun in thirty years mr tate almost threw the rifle at atticus id feel mighty comfortable if you did now he said in a fog jem and i watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of the street he walked quickly but i thought he moved like an underwater swimmer time had slowed to a nauseating crawl when atticus raised his glasses calpurnia murmured sweet jesus help him and put her hands to her cheeks atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead they slipped down and he dropped them in the street in the silence i heard them crack atticus rubbed his eyes and chin we saw him blink hard in front of the radley gate tim johnson had made up what was left of his mind he had finally turned himself around to pursue his original course up our street he made two steps forward then stopped and raised his head we saw his body go rigid with movements so swift they seemed simultaneous atticuss hand yanked a balltipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder the rifle cracked tim johnson leaped flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk in a brownandwhite heap he didnt know what hit him mr tate jumped off the porch and ran to the radley place he stopped in front of the dog squatted turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye you were a little to the right mr finch he called always was answered atticus if i had my druthers id take a shotgun he stooped and picked up his glasses ground the broken lenses to powder under his heel and went to mr tate and stood looking down at tim johnson doors opened one by one and the neighborhood slowly came alive miss maudie walked down the steps with miss stephanie crawford jem was paralyzed i pinched him to get him moving but when atticus saw us coming he called stay where you are when mr tate and atticus returned to the yard mr tate was smiling ill have zeebo collect him he said you havent forgot much mr finch they say it never leaves you atticus was silent atticus said jem yes nothin i saw that oneshot finch atticus wheeled around and faced miss maudie they looked at one another without saying anything and atticus got into the sheriffs car come here he said to jem dont you go near that dog you understand dont go near him hes just as dangerous dead as alive yes sir said jem atticus what son nothing whats the matter with you boy cant you talk said mr tate grinning at jem didnt you know your daddys hush heck said atticus lets go back to town when they drove away jem and i went to miss stephanies front steps we sat waiting for zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck jem sat in numb confusion and miss stephanie said uh uh uh whoda thought of a mad dog in february maybe he wadnt mad maybe he was just crazy id hate to see harry johnsons face when he gets in from the mobile run and finds atticus finchs shot his dog bet he was just full of fleas from somewhere miss maudie said miss stephanied be singing a different tune if tim johnson was still coming up the street that theyd find out soon enough theyd send his head to montgomery jem became vaguely articulate d you see him scout d you see him just standin there n all of a sudden he just relaxed all over an it looked like that gun was a part of him an he did it so quick like i hafta aim for ten minutes fore i can hit somethin miss maudie grinned wickedly well now miss jean louise she said still think your father cant do anything still ashamed of him nome i said meekly forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the jews harp atticus finch was the deadest shot in maycomb county in his time dead shot echoed jem thats what i said jem finch guess youll change your tune now the very idea didnt you know his nickname was ol oneshot when he was a boy why down at the landing when he was coming up if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves hed complain about wasting ammunition he never said anything about that jem muttered never said anything about it did he no maam wonder why he never goes huntin now i said maybe i can tell you said miss maudie if your fathers anything hes civilized in his heart marksmanships a gift of god a talentoh you have to practice to make it perfect but shootins different from playing the piano or the like i think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that god had given him an unfair advantage over most living things i guess he decided he wouldnt shoot till he had to and he had to today looks like hed be proud of it i said people in their right minds never take pride in their talents said miss maudie we saw zeebo drive up he took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck and gingerly lifted tim johnson he pitched the dog onto the truck then poured something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where tim fell dont yawl come over here for a while he called when we went home i told jem wed really have something to talk about at school on monday jem turned on me dont say anything about it scout he said what i certainly am aint everybodys daddy the deadest shot in maycomb county jem said i reckon if hed wanted us to know it heda told us if he was proud of it heda told us maybe it just slipped his mind i said naw scout its something you wouldnt understand atticus is real old but i wouldnt care if he couldnt do anythingi wouldnt care if he couldnt do a blessed thing jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse running after it he called back atticus is a gentleman just like me when we were small jem and i confined our activities to the southern neighborhood but when i was well into the second grade at school and tormenting boo radley became passe the business section of maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the real property of mrs henry lafayette dubose it was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more but jem said i had to grow up some time mrs dubose lived alone except for a negro girl in constant attendance two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dogtrot hall she was very old she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair it was rumored that she kept a csa pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps jem and i hated her if she was on the porch when we passed we would be raked by her wrathful gaze subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up which was always nothing we had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it we could do nothing to please her if i said as sunnily as i could hey mrs dubose i would receive for an answer dont you say hey to me you ugly girl you say good afternoon mrs dubose she was vicious once she heard jem refer to our father as atticus and her reaction was apoplectic besides being the sassiest most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mothers death a lovelier lady than our mother never lived she said and it was heartbreaking the way atticus finch let her children run wild i did not remember our mother but jem didhe would tell me about her sometimesand he went livid when mrs dubose shot us this message jem having survived boo radley a mad dog and other terrors had concluded that it was cowardly to stop at miss rachels front steps and wait and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet atticus coming from work countless evenings atticus would find jem furious at something mrs dubose had said when we went by easy does it son atticus would say shes an old lady and shes ill you just hold your head high and be a gentleman whatever she says to you its your job not to let her make you mad jem would say she must not be very sick she hollered so when the three of us came to her house atticus would sweep off his hat wave gallantly to her and say good evening mrs dubose you look like a picture this evening i never heard atticus say like a picture of what he would tell her the courthouse news and would say he hoped with all his heart shed have a good day tomorrow he would return his hat to his head swing me to his shoulders in her very presence and we would go home in the twilight it was times like these when i thought my father who hated guns and had never been to any wars was the bravest man who ever lived the day after jems twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets so we headed for town in the early afternoon jem thought he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me i had long had my eye on that baton it was at v j elmores it was bedecked with sequins and tinsel it cost seventeen cents it was then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the maycomb county high school band having developed my talent to where i could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down i had caused calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand i felt that i could overcome this defect with a real baton and i thought it generous of jem to buy one for me mrs dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by where are you two going at this time of day she shouted playing hooky i suppose ill just call up the principal and tell him she put her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face aw its saturday mrs dubose said jem makes no difference if its saturday she said obscurely i wonder if your father knows where you are mrs dubose weve been goin to town by ourselves since we were this high jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk dont you lie to me she yelled jeremy finch maudie atkinson told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning shes going to tell your father and then youll wish you never saw the light of day if you arent sent to the reform school before next week my names not dubose jem who hadnt been near miss maudies scuppernong arbor since last summer and who knew miss maudie wouldnt tell atticus if he had issued a general denial dont you contradict me mrs dubose bawled and you she pointed an arthritic finger at mewhat are you doing in those overalls you should be in a dress and camisole young lady youll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesnt change your waysa finch waiting on tables at the ok cafehah i was terrified the ok cafe was a dim organization on the north side of the square i grabbed jems hand but he shook me loose come on scout he whispered dont pay any attention to her just hold your head high and be a gentleman but mrs dubose held us not only a finch waiting on tables but one in the courthouse lawing for niggers jem stiffened mrs duboses shot had gone home and she knew it yes indeed what has this world come to when a finch goes against his raising ill tell you she put her hand to her mouth when she drew it away it trailed a long silver thread of saliva your fathers no better than the niggers and trash he works for jem was scarlet i pulled at his sleeve and we were followed up the sidewalk by a philippic on our familys moral degeneration the major premise of which was that half the finches were in the asylum anyway but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a state i wasnt sure what jem resented most but i took umbrage at mrs duboses assessment of the familys mental hygiene i had become almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at atticus but this was the first one coming from an adult except for her remarks about atticus mrs duboses attack was only routine there was a hint of summer in the airin the shadows it was cool but the sun was warm which meant good times coming no school and dill jem bought his steam engine and we went by elmores for my baton jem took no pleasure in his acquisition he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home on the way home i nearly hit mr link deas who said look out now scout when i missed a toss and when we approached mrs duboses house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times she was not on the porch in later years i sometimes wondered exactly what made jem do it what made him break the bonds of you just be a gentleman son and the phase of selfconscious rectitude he had recently entered jem had probably stood as much guff about atticus lawing for niggers as had i and i took it for granted that he kept his temperhe had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse at the time however i thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad what jem did was something id do as a matter of course had i not been under atticuss interdict which i assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies we had just come to her gate when jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into mrs duboses front yard forgetting everything atticus had said forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls forgetting that if mrs dubose missed her girl jessie probably wouldnt he did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush mrs dubose owned until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves he bent my baton against his knee snapped it in two and threw it down by that time i was shrieking jem yanked my hair said he didnt care hed do it again if he got a chance and if i didnt shut up hed pull every hair out of my head i didnt shut up and he kicked me i lost my balance and fell on my face jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry there was nothing to say we did not choose to meet atticus coming home that evening we skulked around the kitchen until calpurnia threw us out by some voodoo system calpurnia seemed to know all about it she was a less than satisfactory source of palliation but she did give jem a hot biscuitandbutter which he tore in half and shared with me it tasted like cotton we went to the livingroom i picked up a football magazine found a picture of dixie howell showed it to jem and said this looks like you that was the nicest thing i could think to say to him but it was no help he sat by the windows hunched down in a rocking chair scowling waiting daylight faded two geological ages later we heard the soles of atticuss shoes scrape the front steps the screen door slammed there was a pauseatticus was at the hat rack in the halland we heard him call jem his voice was like the winter wind atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us there frozen still he carried my baton in one hand its filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug he held out his other hand it contained fat camellia buds jem he said are you responsible for this yes sir whyd you do it jem said softly she said you lawed for niggers and trash you did this because she said that jems lips moved but his yes sir was inaudible son i have no doubt that youve been annoyed by your contemporaries about me lawing for niggers as you say but to do something like this to a sick old lady is inexcusable i strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with mrs dubose said atticus come straight home afterward jem did not move go on i said i followed jem out of the livingroom come back here atticus said to me i came back atticus picked up the mobile press and sat down in the rocking chair jem had vacated for the life of me i did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a confederate army relic of course jem antagonized me sometimes until i could kill him but when it came down to it he was all i had atticus did not seem to realize this or if he did he didnt care i hated him for that but when you are in trouble you become easily tired soon i was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me youre mighty big to be rocked he said you dont care what happens to him i said you just send him on to get shot at when all he was doin was standin up for you atticus pushed my head under his chin its not time to worry yet he said i never thought jemd be the one to lose his head over thisthought id have more trouble with you i said i didnt see why we had to keep our heads anyway that nobody i knew at school had to keep his head about anything scout said atticus when summer comes youll have to keep your head about far worse things its not fair for you and jem i know that but sometimes we have to make the best of things and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are downwell all i can say is when you and jem are grown maybe youll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that i didnt let you down this case tom robinsons case is something that goes to the essence of a mans consciencescout i couldnt go to church and worship god if i didnt try to help that man atticus you must be wrong hows that well most folks seem to think theyre right and youre wrong theyre certainly entitled to think that and theyre entitled to full respect for their opinions said atticus but before i can live with other folks ive got to live with myself the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience when jem returned he found me still in atticuss lap well son said atticus he set me on my feet and i made a secret reconnaissance of jem he seemed to be all in one piece but he had a queer look on his face perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel i cleaned it up for her and said i was sorry but i aint and that id work on em ever saturday and try to make em grow back out there was no point in saying you were sorry if you arent said atticus jem shes old and ill you cant hold her responsible for what she says and does of course id rather shed have said it to me than to either of you but we cant always have our druthers jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet atticus he said she wants me to read to her read to her yes sir she wants me to come every afternoon after school and saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours atticus do i have to certainly but she wants me to do it for a month then youll do it for a month jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in finally he said atticus its all right on the sidewalk but inside itsits all dark and creepy theres shadows and things on the ceiling atticus smiled grimly that should appeal to your imagination just pretend youre inside the radley house the following monday afternoon jem and i climbed the steep front steps to mrs duboses house and padded down the open hallway jem armed with ivanhoe and full of superior knowledge knocked at the second door on the left mrs dubose he called jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door is that you jem finch she said you got your sister with you i dont know let em both in jessie said mrs dubose jessie admitted us and went off to the kitchen an oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold an odor i had met many times in rainrotted gray houses where there are coaloil lamps water dippers and unbleached domestic sheets it always made me afraid expectant watchful in the corner of the room was a brass bed and in the bed was mrs dubose i wondered if jems activities had put her there and for a moment i felt sorry for her she was lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly there was a marbletopped washstand by her bed on it were a glass with a teaspoon in it a red ear syringe a box of absorbent cotton and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs so you brought that dirty little sister of yours did you was her greeting jem said quietly my sister aint dirty and i aint scared of you although i noticed his knees shaking i was expecting a tirade but all she said was you may commence reading jeremy jem sat down in a canebottom chair and opened ivanhoe i pulled up another one and sat beside him come closer said mrs dubose come to the side of the bed we moved our chairs forward this was the nearest i had ever been to her and the thing i wanted most to do was move my chair back again she was horrible her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase and the corners of her mouth glistened with wet which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves enclosing her chin oldage liver spots dotted her cheeks and her pale eyes had black pinpoint pupils her hands were knobby and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails her bottom plate was not in and her upper lip protruded from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it this made the wet move faster i didnt look any more than i had to jem reopened ivanhoe and began reading i tried to keep up with him but he read too fast when jem came to a word he didnt know he skipped it but mrs dubose would catch him and make him spell it out jem read for perhaps twenty minutes during which time i looked at the sootstained mantelpiece out the window anywhere to keep from looking at her as he read along i noticed that mrs duboses corrections grew fewer and farther between that jem had even left one sentence dangling in midair she was not listening i looked toward the bed something had happened to her she lay on her back with the quilts up to her chin only her head and shoulders were visible her head moved slowly from side to side from time to time she would open her mouth wide and i could see her tongue undulate faintly cords of saliva would collect on her lips she would draw them in then open her mouth again her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own it worked separate and apart from the rest of her out and in like a clam hole at low tide occasionally it would say pt like some viscous substance coming to a boil i pulled jems sleeve he looked at me then at the bed her head made its regular sweep toward us and jem said mrs dubose are you all right she did not hear him the alarm clock went off and scared us stiff a minute later nerves still tingling jem and i were on the sidewalk headed for home we did not run away jessie sent us before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing jem and me out of it shoo she said you all go home jem hesitated at the door its time for her medicine jessie said as the door swung shut behind us i saw jessie walking quickly toward mrs duboses bed it was only three fortyfive when we got home so jem and i dropkicked in the back yard until it was time to meet atticus atticus had two yellow pencils for me and a football magazine for jem which i suppose was a silent reward for our first days session with mrs dubose jem told him what happened did she frighten you asked atticus no sir said jem but shes so nasty she has fits or somethin she spits a lot she cant help that when people are sick they dont look nice sometimes she scared me i said atticus looked at me over his glasses you dont have to go with jem you know the next afternoon at mrs duboses was the same as the first and so was the next until gradually a pattern emerged everything would begin normallythat is mrs dubose would hound jem for a while on her favorite subjects her camellias and our fathers niggerloving propensities she would grow increasingly silent then go away from us the alarm clock would ring jessie would shoo us out and the rest of the day was ours atticus i said one evening what exactly is a niggerlover atticuss face was grave has somebody been calling you that no sir mrs dubose calls you that she warms up every afternoon calling you that francis called me that last christmas thats where i first heard it is that the reason you jumped on him asked atticus yes sir then why are you asking me what it means i tried to explain to atticus that it wasnt so much what francis said that had infuriated me as the way he had said it it was like hed said snotnose or somethin scout said atticus niggerlover is just one of those terms that dont mean anythinglike snotnose its hard to explainignorant trashy people use it when they think somebodys favoring negroes over and above themselves its slipped into usage with some people like ourselves when they want a common ugly term to label somebody you arent really a niggerlover then are you i certainly am i do my best to love everybody im hard put sometimesbaby its never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name it just shows you how poor that person is it doesnt hurt you so dont let mrs dubose get you down she has enough troubles of her own one afternoon a month later jem was ploughing his way through sir walter scout as jem called him and mrs dubose was correcting him at every turn when there was a knock on the door come in she screamed atticus came in he went to the bed and took mrs duboses hand i was coming from the office and didnt see the children he said i thought they might still be here mrs dubose smiled at him for the life of me i could not figure out how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so do you know what time it is atticus she said exactly fourteen minutes past five the alarm clocks set for fivethirty i want you to know that it suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at mrs duboses that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day and that she was well into one of her fits by the time it sounded today she had antagonized jem for nearly two hours with no intention of having a fit and i felt hopelessly trapped the alarm clock was the signal for our release if one day it did not ring what would we do i have a feeling that jems reading days are numbered said atticus only a week longer i think she said just to make sure jem rose but atticus put out his hand and jem was silent on the way home jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasnt fair just one more week son said atticus no said jem yes said atticus the following week found us back at mrs duboses the alarm clock had ceased sounding but mrs dubose would release us with thatll do so late in the afternoon atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned although her fits had passed off she was in every other way her old self when sir walter scott became involved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles mrs dubose would become bored and pick on us jeremy finch i told you youd live to regret tearing up my camellias you regret it now dont you jem would say he certainly did thought you could kill my snowonthemountain did you well jessie says the tops growing back out next time youll know how to do it right wont you youll pull it up by the roots wont you jem would say he certainly would dont you mutter at me boy you hold up your head and say yes maam dont guess you feel like holding it up though with your father what he is jems chin would come up and he would gaze at mrs dubose with a face devoid of resentment through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and detached interest which he would present to her in answer to her most bloodcurdling inventions at last the day came when mrs dubose said thatll do one afternoon she added and thats all goodday to you it was over we bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief leaping and howling that spring was a good one the days grew longer and gave us more playing time jems mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football player in the nation every night atticus would read us the sports pages of the newspapers alabama might go to the rose bowl again this year judging from its prospects not one of whose names we could pronounce atticus was in the middle of windy seatons column one evening when the telephone rang he answered it then went to the hat rack in the hall im going down to mrs duboses for a while he said i wont be long but atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime when he returned he was carrying a candy box atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the floor beside his chair whatd she want asked jem we had not seen mrs dubose for over a month she was never on the porch any more when we passed shes dead son said atticus she died a few minutes ago oh said jem well well is right said atticus shes not suffering any more she was sick for a long time son didnt you know what her fits were jem shook his head mrs dubose was a morphine addict said atticus she took it as a painkiller for years the doctor put her on it shed have spent the rest of her life on it and died without so much agony but she was too contrary sir said jem atticus said just before your escapade she called me to make her will dr reynolds told her she had only a few months left her business affairs were in perfect order but she said theres still one thing out of order what was that jem was perplexed she said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody jem when youre sick as she was its all right to take anything to make it easier but it wasnt all right for her she said she meant to break herself of it before she died and thats what she did jem said you mean thats what her fits were yes thats what they were most of the time you were reading to her i doubt if she heard a word you said her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarm clock if you hadnt fallen into her hands id have made you go read to her anyway it may have been some distraction there was another reason did she die free asked jem as the mountain air said atticus she was conscious to the last almost conscious he smiled and cantankerous she still disapproved heartily of my doings and said id probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail she had jessie fix you this box atticus reached down and picked up the candy box he handed it to jem jem opened the box inside surrounded by wads of damp cotton was a white waxy perfect camellia it was a snowonthemountain jems eyes nearly popped out of his head old helldevil old helldevil he screamed flinging it down why cant she leave me alone in a flash atticus was up and standing over him jem buried his face in atticuss shirt front shh he said i think that was her way of telling youeverythings all right now jem everythings all right you know she was a great lady a lady jem raised his head his face was scarlet after all those things she said about you a lady she was she had her own views about things a lot different from mine maybe son i told you that if you hadnt lost your head id have made you go read to her i wanted you to see something about heri wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what you rarely win but sometimes you do mrs dubose won all ninetyeight pounds of her according to her views she died beholden to nothing and nobody she was the bravest person i ever knew jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire he picked up the camellia and when i went off to bed i saw him fingering the wide petals atticus was reading the paper part two jem was twelve he was difficult to live with inconsistent moody his appetite was appalling and he told me so many times to stop pestering him i consulted atticus reckon hes got a tapeworm atticus said no jem was growing i must be patient with him and disturb him as little as possible this change in jem had come about in a matter of weeks mrs dubose was not cold in her gravejem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read to her overnight it seemed jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to impose them on me several times he went so far as to tell me what to do after one altercation when jem hollered its time you started bein a girl and acting right i burst into tears and fled to calpurnia dont you fret too much over mister jem she began mister jem yeah hes just about mister jem now he aint that old i said all he needs is somebody to beat him up and i aint big enough baby said calpurnia i just cant help it if mister jems growin up hes gonna want to be off to himself a lot now doin whatever boys do so you just come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome well find lots of things to do in here the beginning of that summer boded well jem could do as he pleased calpurnia would do until dill came she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl but summer came and dill was not there i received a letter and a snapshot from him the letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed and he would have to stay in meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat his father was a lawyer like atticus only much younger dills new father had a pleasant face which made me glad dill had captured him but i was crushed dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together so please write the fact that i had a permanent fiance was little compensation for his absence i had never thought about it but summer was dill by the fishpool smoking string dills eyes alive with complicated plans to make boo radley emerge summer was the swiftness with which dill would reach up and kiss me when jem was not looking the longings we sometimes felt each other feel with him life was routine without him life was unbearable i stayed miserable for two days as if that were not enough the state legislature was called into emergency session and atticus left us for two weeks the governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles off the ship of state there were sitdown strikes in birmingham bread lines in the cities grew longer people in the country grew poorer but these were events remote from the world of jem and me we were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the montgomery advertiser above the caption maycombs finch it showed atticus barefooted and in short pants chained to a desk he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolouslooking girls yelled yoohoo at him thats a compliment explained jem he spends his time doin things that wouldnt get done if nobody did em huh in addition to jems newly developed characteristics he had acquired a maddening air of wisdom oh scout its like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things that kind of things pretty dry to most men how do you know oh go on and leave me alone im readin the paper jem got his wish i departed for the kitchen while she was shelling peas calpurnia suddenly said what am i gonna do about you alls church this sunday nothing i reckon atticus left us collection calpurnias eyes narrowed and i could tell what was going through her mind cal i said you know well behave we havent done anything in church in years calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy sunday when we were both fatherless and teacherless left to its own devices the class tied eunice ann simpson to a chair and placed her in the furnace room we forgot her trooped upstairs to church and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes persisting until someone investigated and brought forth eunice ann saying she didnt want to play shadrach any morejem finch said she wouldnt get burnt if she had enough faith but it was hot down there besides cal this isnt the first time atticus has left us i protested yeah but he makes certain your teachers gonna be there i didnt hear him say this timereckon he forgot it calpurnia scratched her head suddenly she smiled howd you and mister jem like to come to church with me tomorrow really how bout it grinned calpurnia if calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before it was nothing compared to her supervision of that saturday nights routine she made me soap all over twice drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with octagon soap and castile she had trusted jem for years but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst cant anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin next morning she began earlier than usual to go over our clothes when calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen that morning it was covered with our sunday habiliments she had put so much starch in my dress it came up like a tent when i sat down she made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist she went over my patentleather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them its like we were goin to mardi gras said jem whats all this for cal i dont want anybody sayin i dont look after my children she muttered mister jem you absolutely cant wear that tie with that suit its green smatter with that suits blue cant you tell hee hee i howled jems color blind his face flushed angrily but calpurnia said now you all quit that youre gonna go to first purchase with smiles on your faces first purchase african me church was in the quarters outside the southern town limits across the old sawmill tracks it was an ancient paintpeeled frame building the only church in maycomb with a steeple and bell called first purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves negroes worshiped in it on sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays the churchyard was brickhard clay as was the cemetery beside it if someone died during a dry spell the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth a few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken cocacola bottles lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily stumps of burnedout candles stood at the heads of infant graves it was a happy cemetery the warm bittersweet smell of clean negro welcomed us as we entered the churchyardhearts of love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida snuff hoyts cologne browns mule peppermint and lilac talcum when they saw jem and me with calpurnia the men stepped back and took off their hats the women crossed their arms at their waists weekday gestures of respectful attention they parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us calpurnia walked between jem and me responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors what you up to miss cal said a voice behind us calpurnias hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around standing in the path behind us was a tall negro woman her weight was on one leg she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip pointing at us with upturned palm she was bulletheaded with strange almondshaped eyes straight nose and an indianbow mouth she seemed seven feet high i felt calpurnias hand dig into my shoulder what you want lula she asked in tones i had never heard her use she spoke quietly contemptuously i wants to know why you bringin white chillun to nigger church theys my compny said calpurnia again i thought her voice strange she was talking like the rest of them yeah an i reckon yous compny at the finch house durin the week a murmur ran through the crowd dont you fret calpurnia whispered to me but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly when lula came up the pathway toward us calpurnia said stop right there nigger lula stopped but she said you aint got no business bringin white chillun herethey got their church we got ourn it is our church aint it miss cal calpurnia said its the same god aint it jem said lets go home cal they dont want us here i agreed they did not want us here i sensed rather than saw that we were being advanced upon they seemed to be drawing closer to us but when i looked up at calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes when i looked down the pathway again lula was gone in her place was a solid mass of colored people one of them stepped from the crowd it was zeebo the garbage collector mister jem he said were mighty glad to have you all here dont pay no tention to lula shes contentious because reverend sykes threatened to church her shes a troublemaker from way back got fancy ideas an haughty wayswere mighty glad to have you all with that calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by reverend sykes who led us to the front pew first purchase was unceiled and unpainted within along its walls unlighted kerosene lamps hung on brass brackets pine benches served as pews behind the rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed god is love the churchs only decoration except a rotogravure print of hunts the light of the world there was no sign of piano organ hymnbooks church programsthe familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every sunday it was dim inside with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation at each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish garden of gethsemane courtesy tyndals hardware co younameitwesellit calpurnia motioned jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us she fished in her purse drew out her handkerchief and untied the hard wad of change in its corner she gave a dime to me and a dime to jem weve got ours he whispered you keep it calpurnia said youre my company jems face showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime but his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket i did likewise with no qualms cal i whispered where are the hymnbooks we dont have any she said well how shh she said reverend sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the congregation to silence he was a short stocky man in a black suit black tie white shirt and a gold watchchain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows he said brethren and sisters we are particularly glad to have company with us this morning mister and miss finch you all know their father before i begin i will read some announcements reverend sykes shuffled some papers chose one and held it at arms length the missionary society meets in the home of sister annette reeves next tuesday bring your sewing he read from another paper you all know of brother tom robinsons trouble he has been a faithful member of first purchase since he was a boy the collection taken up today and for the next three sundays will go to helenhis wife to help her out at home i punched jem thats the tom atticuss de shh i turned to calpurnia but was hushed before i opened my mouth subdued i fixed my attention upon reverend sykes who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down will the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn he said zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle stopping in front of us and facing the congregation he was carrying a battered hymnbook he opened it and said well sing number two seventythree this was too much for me howre we gonna sing it if there aint any hymnbooks calpurnia smiled hush baby she whispered youll see in a minute zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery theres a land beyond the river miraculously on pitch a hundred voices sang out zeebos words the last syllable held to a husky hum was followed by zeebo saying that we call the sweet forever music again swelled around us the last note lingered and zeebo met it with the next line and we only reach that shore by faiths decree the congregation hesitated zeebo repeated the line carefully and it was sung at the chorus zeebo closed the book a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help on the dying notes of jubilee zeebo said in that faroff sweet forever just beyond the shining river line for line voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur i looked at jem who was looking at zeebo from the corners of his eyes i didnt believe it either but we had both heard it reverend sykes then called on the lord to bless the sick and the suffering a procedure no different from our church practice except reverend sykes directed the deitys attention to several specific cases his sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin an austere declaration of the motto on the wall behind him he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews gambling and strange women bootleggers caused enough trouble in the quarters but women were worse again as i had often met it in my own church i was confronted with the impurity of women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen jem and i had heard the same sermon sunday after sunday with only one exception reverend sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapses from grace jim hardy had been absent from church for five sundays and he wasnt sick constance jackson had better watch her waysshe was in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbors she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the quarters reverend sykes closed his sermon he stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and requested the morning offering a proceeding that was strange to jem and me one by one the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can jem and i followed suit and received a soft thank you thank you as our dimes clinked to our amazement reverend sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the coins into his hand he straightened up and said this is not enough we must have ten dollars the congregation stirred you all know what its forhelen cant leave those children to work while toms in jail if everybody gives one more dime well have it reverend sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church alec shut the doors nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse naw cal jem whispered when she handed him a shiny quarter we can put ours in gimme your dime scout the church was becoming stuffy and it occurred to me that reverend sykes intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock fans crackled feet shuffled tobaccochewers were in agony reverend sykes startled me by saying sternly carlow richardson i havent seen you up this aisle yet a thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin the congregation murmured approval reverend sykes then said i want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice and give one more dime apiece then well have it slowly painfully the ten dollars was collected the door was opened and the gust of warm air revived us zeebo lined on jordans stormy banks and church was over i wanted to stay and explore but calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her at the church door while she paused to talk with zeebo and his family jem and i chatted with reverend sykes i was bursting with questions but decided i would wait and let calpurnia answer them we were specially glad to have you all here said reverend sykes this church has no better friend than your daddy my curiosity burst why were you all takin up collection for tom robinsons wife didnt you hear why asked reverend sykes helens got three littleuns and she cant go out to work why cant she take em with her reverend i asked it was customary for field negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while their parents workedusually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton those unable to sit were strapped papoosestyle on their mothers backs or resided in extra cotton bags reverend sykes hesitated to tell you the truth miss jean louise helens finding it hard to get work these days when its picking time i think mr link deasll take her why not reverend before he could answer i felt calpurnias hand on my shoulder at its pressure i said we thank you for lettin us come jem echoed me and we made our way homeward cal i know tom robinsons in jail an hes done somethin awful but why wont folks hire helen i asked calpurnia in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat walked between jem and me its because of what folks say toms done she said folks arent anxious toto have anything to do with any of his family just what did he do cal calpurnia sighed old mr bob ewell accused him of rapin his girl an had him arrested an put in jail mr ewell my memory stirred does he have anything to do with those ewells that come every first day of school an then go home why atticus said they were absolute trashi never heard atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the ewells he said yeah those are the ones well if everybody in maycomb knows what kind of folks the ewells are theyd be glad to hire helen whats rape cal its somethin youll have to ask mr finch about she said he can explain it better than i can you all hungry the reverend took a long time unwindin this morning hes not usually so tedious hes just like our preacher said jem but why do you all sing hymns that way linin she asked is that what it is yeah its called linin theyve done it that way as long as i can remember jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some hymnbooks calpurnia laughed wouldnt do any good she said they cant read cant read i asked all those folks thats right calpurnia nodded cant but about four folks in first purchase read im one of em whered you go to school cal asked jem nowhere lets see now who taught me my letters it was miss maudie atkinsons aunt old miss buford are you that old im older than mr finch even calpurnia grinned not sure how much though we started rememberin one time trying to figure out how old i wasi can remember back just a few years moren he can so im not much older when you take off the fact that men cant remember as well as women whats your birthday cal i just have it on christmas its easier to remember that wayi dont have a real birthday but cal jem protested you dont look even near as old as atticus colored folks dont show their ages so fast she said maybe because they cant read cal did you teach zeebo yeah mister jem there wasnt a school even when he was a boy i made him learn though zeebo was calpurnias eldest son if i had ever thought about it i would have known that calpurnia was of mature yearszeebo had halfgrown childrenbut then i had never thought about it did you teach him out of a primer like us i asked no i made him get a page of the bible every day and there was a book miss buford taught me out ofbet you dont know where i got it she said we didnt know calpurnia said your granddaddy finch gave it to me were you from the landing jem asked you never told us that i certainly am mister jem grew up down there between the buford place and the landin ive spent all my days workin for the finches or the bufords an i moved to maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married what was the book cal i asked blackstones commentaries jem was thunderstruck you mean you taught zeebo outa that why yes sir mister jem calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth they were the only books i had your grandaddy said mr blackstone wrote fine english thats why you dont talk like the rest of em said jem the rest of who rest of the colored folks cal but you talked like they did in church that calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me the idea that she had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one to say nothing of her having command of two languages cal i asked why do you talk niggertalk to theto your folks when you know its not right well in the first place im black that doesnt mean you hafta talk that way when you know better said jem calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head then pressed her hat down carefully over her ears its right hard to say she said suppose you and scout talked coloredfolks talk at home itd be out of place wouldnt it now what if i talked whitefolks talk at church and with my neighbors theyd think i was puttin on airs to beat moses but cal you know better i said its not necessary to tell all you know its not ladylikein the second place folks dont like to have somebody around knowin more than they do it aggravates em youre not gonna change any of them by talkin right theyve got to want to learn themselves and when they dont want to learn theres nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language cal can i come to see you sometimes she looked down at me see me honey you see me every day out to your house i said sometimes after work atticus can get me any time you want to she said wed be glad to have you we were on the sidewalk by the radley place look on the porch yonder jem said i looked over to the radley place expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing the swing was empty i mean our porch said jem i looked down the street enarmored upright uncompromising aunt alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life put my bag in the front bedroom calpurnia was the first thing aunt alexandra said jean louise stop scratching your head was the second thing she said calpurnia picked up auntys heavy suitcase and opened the door ill take it said jem and took it i heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump the sound had a dull permanence about it have you come for a visit aunty i asked aunt alexandras visits from the landing were rare and she traveled in state she owned a bright green square buick and a black chauffeur both kept in an unhealthy state of tidiness but today they were nowhere to be seen didnt your father tell you she asked jem and i shook our heads probably he forgot hes not in yet is he nome he doesnt usually get back till late afternoon said jem well your father and i decided it was time i came to stay with you for a while for a while in maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years jem and i exchanged glances jems growing up now and you are too she said to me we decided that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence it wont be many years jean louise before you become interested in clothes and boys i could have made several answers to this cals a girl it would be many years before i would be interested in boys i would never be interested in clothes but i kept quiet what about uncle jimmy asked jem is he comin too oh no hes staying at the landing hell keep the place going the moment i said wont you miss him i realized that this was not a tactful question uncle jimmy present or uncle jimmy absent made not much difference he never said anything aunt alexandra ignored my question i could think of nothing else to say to her in fact i could never think of anything to say to her and i sat thinking of past painful conversations between us how are you jean louise fine thank you maam how are you very well thank you what have you been doing with yourself nothin dont you do anything nome certainly you have friends yessum well what do you all do nothin it was plain that aunty thought me dull in the extreme because i once heard her tell atticus that i was sluggish there was a story behind all this but i had no desire to extract it from her then today was sunday and aunt alexandra was positively irritable on the lords day i guess it was her sunday corset she was not fat but solid and she chose protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights pinched in her waist flared out her rear and managed to suggest that aunt alexandras was once an hourglass figure from any angle it was formidable the remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relatives appear but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway it was atticus home from montgomery jem forgetting his dignity ran with me to meet him jem seized his briefcase and bag i jumped into his arms felt his vague dry kiss and said d you bring me a book d you know auntys here atticus answered both questions in the affirmative howd you like for her to come live with us i said i would like it very much which was a lie but one must lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one cant do anything about them we felt it was time you children neededwell its like this scout atticus said your aunts doing me a favor as well as you all i cant stay here all day with you and the summers going to be a hot one yes sir i said not understanding a word he said i had an idea however that aunt alexandras appearance on the scene was not so much atticuss doing as hers aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family and i suppose her coming to live with us was in that category maycomb welcomed her miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight miss stephanie crawford had long visits with aunt alexandra consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying uh uh uh miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoons and mr nathan radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace aunt alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us her missionary society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess she did not permit calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the society through long reports on rice christians she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club to all parties present and participating in the life of the county aunt alexandra was one of the last of her kind she had riverboat boardingschool manners let any moral come along and she would uphold it she was born in the objective case she was an incurable gossip when aunt alexandra went to school selfdoubt could not be found in any textbook so she knew not its meaning she was never bored and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative she would arrange advise caution and warn she never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own a habit that amused jem rather than annoyed him aunty better watch how she talksscratch most folks in maycomb and theyre kin to us aunt alexandra in underlining the moral of young sam merriweathers suicide said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family let a sixteenyearold girl giggle in the choir and aunty would say it just goes to show you all the penfield women are flighty everybody in maycomb it seemed had a streak a drinking streak a gambling streak a mean streak a funny streak once when aunty assured us that miss stephanie crawfords tendency to mind other peoples business was hereditary atticus said sister when you stop to think about it our generations practically the first in the finch family not to marry its cousins would you say the finches have an incestuous streak aunty said no thats where we got our small hands and feet i never understood her preoccupation with heredity somewhere i had received the impression that fine folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had but aunt alexandra was of the opinion obliquely expressed that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was that makes the ewells fine folks then said jem the tribe of which burris ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the maycomb dump and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations aunt alexandras theory had something behind it though maycomb was an ancient town it was twenty miles east of finchs landing awkwardly inland for such an old town but maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimblewittedness of one sinkfield who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pigtrails met the only tavern in the territory sinkfield no patriot served and supplied ammunition to indians and settlers alike neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the alabama territory or the creek nation so long as business was good business was excellent when governor william wyatt bibb with a view to promoting the newly created countys domestic tranquility dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government the surveyors sinkfields guests told their host that he was in the territorial confines of maycomb county and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built had not sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings maycomb would have sat in the middle of winston swamp a place totally devoid of interest instead maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub sinkfields tavern because sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening induced them to bring forward their maps and charts lop off a little here add a bit there and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements he sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags two apiece and one for the governor because its primary reason for existence was government maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most alabama towns its size in the beginning its buildings were solid its courthouse proud its streets graciously wide maycombs proportion of professional people ran high one went there to have his teeth pulled his wagon fixed his heart listened to his money deposited his soul saved his mules vetted but the ultimate wisdom of sinkfields maneuver is open to question he placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those daysriverboat and it took a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to maycomb for storebought goods as a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland although maycomb was ignored during the war between the states reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow it grew inward new people so rarely settled there the same families married the same families until the members of the community looked faintly alike occasionally someone would return from montgomery or mobile with an outsider but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance things were more or less the same during my early years there was indeed a caste system in maycomb but to my mind it worked this way the older citizens the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and years were utterly predictable to one another they took for granted attitudes character shadings even gestures as having been repeated in each generation and refined by time thus the dicta no crawford minds his own business every third merriweather is morbid the truth is not in the delafields all the bufords walk like that were simply guides to daily living never take a check from a delafield without a discreet call to the bank miss maudie atkinsons shoulder stoops because she was a buford if mrs grace merriweather sips gin out of lydia e pinkham bottles its nothing unusualher mother did the same aunt alexandra fitted into the world of maycomb like a hand into a glove but never into the world of jem and me i so often wondered how she could be atticuss and uncle jacks sister that i revived halfremembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots that jem had spun long ago these were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay as she had little to say to jem or me and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went to bed it was summer and we were outdoors of course some afternoons when i would run inside for a drink of water i would find the livingroom overrun with maycomb ladies sipping whispering fanning and i would be called jean louise come speak to these ladies when i appeared in the doorway aunty would look as if she regretted her request i was usually mudsplashed or covered with sand speak to your cousin lily she said one afternoon when she had trapped me in the hall who i said your cousin lily brooke said aunt alexandra she our cousin i didnt know that aunt alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to cousin lily and firm disapproval to me when cousin lily brooke left i knew i was in for it it was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the finch family or to install any pride into his children she summoned jem who sat warily on the sofa beside me she left the room and returned with a purplecovered book on which meditations of joshua s st clair was stamped in gold your cousin wrote this said aunt alexandra he was a beautiful character jem examined the small volume is this the cousin joshua who was locked up for so long aunt alexandra said how did you know that why atticus said he went round the bend at the university said he tried to shoot the president said cousin joshua said he wasnt anything but a sewerinspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol only it just blew up in his hand atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one aunt alexandra was standing stiff as a stork thats all she said well see about this before bedtime i was in jems room trying to borrow a book when atticus knocked and entered he sat on the side of jems bed looked at us soberly then he grinned erhrm he said he was beginning to preface some things he said with a throaty noise and i thought he must at last be getting old but he looked the same i dont exactly know how to say this he began well just say it said jem have we done something our father was actually fidgeting no i just want to explain to you thatyour aunt alexandra asked me son you know youre a finch dont you thats what ive been told jem looked out of the corners of his eyes his voice rose uncontrollably atticus whats the matter atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms im trying to tell you the facts of life jems disgust deepened i know all that stuff he said atticus suddenly grew serious in his lawyers voice without a shade of inflection he said your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and jean louise that you are not from runofthemill people that you are the product of several generations gentle breeding atticus paused watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg gentle breeding he continued when i had found and scratched it and that you should try to live up to your name atticus persevered in spite of us she asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are she wants to talk to you about the family and what its meant to maycomb county through the years so youll have some idea of who you are so you might be moved to behave accordingly he concluded at a gallop stunned jem and i looked at each other then at atticus whose collar seemed to worry him we did not speak to him presently i picked up a comb from jems dresser and ran its teeth along the edge stop that noise atticus said his curtness stung me the comb was midway in its journey and i banged it down for no reason i felt myself beginning to cry but i could not stop this was not my father my father never thought these thoughts my father never spoke so aunt alexandra had put him up to this somehow through my tears i saw jem standing in a similar pool of isolation his head cocked to one side there was nowhere to go but i turned to go and met atticuss vest front i buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light blue cloth his watch ticking the faint crackle of his starched shirt the soft sound of his breathing your stomachs growling i said i know it he said you better take some soda i will he said atticus is all this behavin an stuff gonna make things different i mean are you i felt his hand on the back of my head dont you worry about anything he said its not time to worry when i heard that i knew he had come back to us the blood in my legs began to flow again and i raised my head you really want us to do all that i cant remember everything finches are supposed to do i dont want you to remember it forget it he went to the door and out of the room shutting the door behind him he nearly slammed it but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly as jem and i stared the door opened again and atticus peered around his eyebrows were raised his glasses had slipped get more like cousin joshua every day dont i do you think ill end up costing the family five hundred dollars i know now what he was trying to do but atticus was only a man it takes a woman to do that kind of work although we heard no more about the finch family from aunt alexandra we heard plenty from the town on saturdays armed with our nickels when jem permitted me to accompany him he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear theres his chillun or yonders some finches turning to face our accusers we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the mayco drugstore window or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a hoover cart they cn go loose and rape up the countryside for all of em who run this county care was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed us which reminded me that i had a question to ask atticus whats rape i asked him that night atticus looked around from behind his paper he was in his chair by the window as we grew older jem and i thought it generous to allow atticus thirty minutes to himself after supper he sighed and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent well if thats all it is why did calpurnia dry me up when i asked her what it was atticus looked pensive whats that again well i asked calpurnia comin from church that day what it was and she said ask you but i forgot to and now im askin you his paper was now in his lap again please he said i told him in detail about our trip to church with calpurnia atticus seemed to enjoy it but aunt alexandra who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing put down her embroidery and stared at us you all were coming back from calpurnias church that sunday jem said yessum she took us i remembered something yessum and she promised me i could come out to her house some afternoon atticus ill go next sunday if its all right can i cal said shed come get me if you were off in the car you may not aunt alexandra said it i wheeled around startled then turned back to atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her but it was too late i said i didnt ask you for a big man atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone i ever knew he was on his feet apologize to your aunt he said i didnt ask her i asked you atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye his voice was deadly first apologize to your aunt im sorry aunty i muttered now then he said lets get this clear you do as calpurnia tells you you do as i tell you and as long as your aunts in this house you will do as she tells you understand i understood pondered a while and concluded that the only way i could retire with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom where i stayed long enough to make them think i had to go returning i lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on in the livingroom through the door i could see jem on the sofa with a football magazine in front of his face his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match youve got to do something about her aunty was saying youve let things go on too long atticus too long i dont see any harm in letting her go out there cald look after her there as well as she does here who was the her they were talking about my heart sank me i felt the starched walls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me and for the second time in my life i thought of running away immediately atticus its all right to be softhearted youre an easy man but you have a daughter to think of a daughter whos growing up thats what i am thinking of and dont try to get around it youve got to face it sooner or later and it might as well be tonight we dont need her now atticuss voice was even alexandra calpurnias not leaving this house until she wants to you may think otherwise but i couldnt have got along without her all these years shes a faithful member of this family and youll simply have to accept things the way they are besides sister i dont want you working your head off for usyouve no reason to do that we still need cal as much as we ever did but atticus besides i dont think the childrenve suffered one bit from her having brought them up if anything shes been harder on them in some ways than a mother would have been shes never let them get away with anything shes never indulged them the way most colored nurses do she tried to bring them up according to her lights and cals lights are pretty goodand another thing the children love her i breathed again it wasnt me it was only calpurnia they were talking about revived i entered the livingroom atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and aunt alexandra was worrying her embroidery punk punk punk her needle broke the taut circle she stopped and pulled the cloth tighter punkpunkpunk she was furious jem got up and padded across the rug he motioned me to follow he led me to his room and closed the door his face was grave theyve been fussing scout jem and i fussed a great deal these days but i had never heard of or seen anyone quarrel with atticus it was not a comfortable sight scout try not to antagonize aunty hear atticuss remarks were still rankling which made me miss the request in jems question my feathers rose again you tryin to tell me what to do naw itshes got a lot on his mind now without us worrying him like what atticus didnt appear to have anything especially on his mind its this tom robinson case thats worryin him to death i said atticus didnt worry about anything besides the case never bothered us except about once a week and then it didnt last thats because you cant hold something in your mind but a little while said jem its different with grown folks we his maddening superiority was unbearable these days he didnt want to do anything but read and go off by himself still everything he read he passed along to me but with this difference formerly because he thought id like it now for my edification and instruction jee crawling hova jem who do you think you are now i mean it scout you antagonize aunty and illill spank you with that i was gone you damn morphodite ill kill you he was sitting on the bed and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth he slapped me and i tried another left but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor it nearly knocked the breath out of me but it didnt matter because i knew he was fighting he was fighting me back we were still equals aint so high and mighty now are you i screamed sailing in again he was still on the bed and i couldnt get a firm stance so i threw myself at him as hard as i could hitting pulling pinching gouging what had begun as a fistfight became a brawl we were still struggling when atticus separated us thats all he said both of you go to bed right now taah i said at jem he was being sent to bed at my bedtime who started it asked atticus in resignation jem did he was tryin to tell me what to do i dont have to mind him now do i atticus smiled lets leave it at this you mind jem whenever he can make you fair enough aunt alexandra was present but silent and when she went down the hall with atticus we heard her say just one of the things ive been telling you about a phrase that united us again ours were adjoining rooms as i shut the door between them jem said night scout night i murmured picking my way across the room to turn on the light as i passed the bed i stepped on something warm resilient and rather smooth it was not quite like hard rubber and i had the sensation that it was alive i also heard it move i switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed whatever i had stepped on was gone i tapped on jems door what he said how does a snake feel sort of rough cold dusty why i think theres one under my bed can you come look are you bein funny jem opened the door he was in his pajama bottoms i noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth when he saw i meant what i said he said if you think im gonna put my face down to a snake youve got another think comin hold on a minute he went to the kitchen and fetched the broom you better get up on the bed he said you reckon its really one i asked this was an occasion our houses had no cellars they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground and the entry of reptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace miss rachel haverfords excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet on her washing when she went to hang up her negligee jem made a tentative swipe under the bed i looked over the foot to see if a snake would come out none did jem made a deeper swipe do snakes grunt it aint a snake jem said its somebody suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed jem raised the broom and missed dills head by an inch when it appeared god almighty jems voice was reverent we watched dill emerge by degrees he was a tight fit he stood up and eased his shoulders turned his feet in their ankle sockets rubbed the back of his neck his circulation restored he said hey jem petitioned god again i was speechless im bout to perish said dill got anything to eat in a dream i went to the kitchen i brought him back some milk and half a pan of corn bread left over from supper dill devoured it chewing with his front teeth as was his custom i finally found my voice howd you get here by an involved route refreshed by food dill recited this narrative having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement there were basements in meridian by his new father who disliked him and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmer who heard his cries for help the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through the ventilator dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall still in wrist manacles he wandered two miles out of meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel he traveled with the show all over mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in abbott county alabama just across the river from maycomb he walked the rest of the way howd you get here asked jem he had taken thirteen dollars from his mothers purse caught the nine oclock from meridian and got off at maycomb junction he had walked ten or eleven of the fourteen miles to maycomb off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seeking him and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cotton wagon he had been under the bed for two hours he thought he had heard us in the diningroom and the clink of forks on plates nearly drove him crazy he thought jem and i would never go to bed he had considered emerging and helping me beat jem as jem had grown far taller but he knew mr finch would break it up soon so he thought it best to stay where he was he was worn out dirty beyond belief and home they must not know youre here said jem wed know if they were lookin for you think theyre still searchin all the picture shows in meridian dill grinned you oughta let your mother know where you are said jem you oughta let her know youre here dills eyes flickered at jem and jem looked at the floor then he rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood he went out of the room and down the hall atticus his voice was distant can you come here a minute sir beneath its sweatstreaked dirt dills face went white i felt sick atticus was in the doorway he came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets looking down at dill i finally found my voice its okay dill when he wants you to know somethin he tells you dill looked at me i mean its all right i said you know he wouldnt bother you you know you aint scared of atticus im not scared dill muttered just hungry ill bet atticuss voice had its usual pleasant dryness scout we can do better than a pan of cold corn bread cant we you fill this fellow up and when i get back well see what we can see mr finch dont tell aunt rachel dont make me go back please sir ill run off again whoa son said atticus nobodys about to make you go anywhere but to bed pretty soon im just going over to tell miss rachel youre here and ask her if you could spend the night with usyoud like that wouldnt you and for goodness sake put some of the county back where it belongs the soil erosions bad enough as it is dill stared at my fathers retreating figure hes tryin to be funny i said he means take a bath see there i told you he wouldnt bother you jem was standing in a corner of the room looking like the traitor he was dill i had to tell him he said you cant run three hundred miles off without your mother knowin we left him without a word dill ate and ate and ate he hadnt eaten since last night he used all his money for a ticket boarded the train as he had done many times coolly chatted with the conductor to whom dill was a familiar sight but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on small children traveling a distance alone if youve lost your money the conductor will lend you enough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and beans in the pantry when miss rachels dooo jesus went off in the hall he shivered like a rabbit he bore with fortitude her wait till i get you home your folks are out of their minds worryin was quite calm during thats all the harris in you coming out smiled at her reckon you can stay one night and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face your fathers tired said aunt alexandra her first words in hours it seemed she had been there but i suppose struck dumb most of the time you children get to bed now we left them in the diningroom atticus still mopping his face from rape to riot to runaways we heard him chuckle i wonder what the next two hours will bring since things appeared to have worked out pretty well dill and i decided to be civil to jem besides dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him i put on my pajamas read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep my eyes open dill and jem were quiet when i turned off my reading lamp there was no strip of light under the door to jems room i must have slept a long time for when i was punched awake the room was dim with the light of the setting moon move over scout he thought he had to i mumbled dont stay mad with him dill got in bed beside me i aint he said i just wanted to sleep with you are you waked up by this time i was but lazily so whyd you do it no answer i said whyd you run off was he really hateful like you said naw didnt you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna he just said we would we never did i raised up on my elbow facing dills outline its no reason to run off they dont get around to doin what they say theyre gonna do half the time that wasnt it hethey just wasnt interested in me this was the weirdest reason for flight i had ever heard how come well they stayed gone all the time and when they were home even theyd get off in a room by themselves whatd they do in there nothin just sittin and readinbut they didnt want me with em i pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up you know something i was fixin to run off tonight because there they all were you dont want em around you all the time dill dill breathed his patient breath a halfsigh good night atticuss gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the legislature and i dont know whatyou dont want em around all the time dill you couldnt do anything if they were thats not it as dill explained i found myself wondering what life would be if jem were different even from what he was now what i would do if atticus did not feel the necessity of my presence help and advice why he couldnt get along a day without me even calpurnia couldnt get along unless i was there they needed me dill you aint telling me rightyour folks couldnt do without you they must be just mean to you tell you what to do about that dills voice went on steadily in the darkness the thing is what im tryin to say isthey do get on a lot better without me i cant help them any they aint mean they buy me everything i want but its nowyouvegotitgoplaywithit youve got a roomful of things igotyouthatbooksogoreadit dill tried to deepen his voice youre not a boy boys get out and play baseball with other boys they dont hang around the house worryin their folks dills voice was his own again oh they aint mean they kiss you and hug you good night and good mornin and goodbye and tell you they love youscout lets get us a baby where there was a man dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were you could order one thats a lie aunty said god drops em down the chimney at least thats what i think she said for once auntys diction had not been too clear well that aint so you get babies from each other but theres this man toohe has all these babies just waitin to wake up he breathes life into em dill was off again beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head he could read two books to my one but he preferred the magic of his own inventions he could add and subtract faster than lightning but he preferred his own twilight world a world where babies slept waiting to be gathered like morning lilies he was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown doors dill mm why do you reckon boo radleys never run off dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me maybe he doesnt have anywhere to run off to after many telephone calls much pleading on behalf of the defendant and a long forgiving letter from his mother it was decided that dill could stay we had a week of peace together after that little it seemed a nightmare was upon us it began one evening after supper dill was over aunt alexandra was in her chair in the corner atticus was in his jem and i were on the floor reading it had been a placid week i had minded aunty jem had outgrown the treehouse but helped dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make boo radley come out at no cost to ourselves place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to the front yard and hed follow it like an ant there was a knock on the front door jem answered it and said it was mr heck tate well ask him to come in said atticus i already did theres some men outside in the yard they want you to come out in maycomb grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons death and politics i wondered who had died jem and i went to the front door but atticus called go back in the house jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen aunt alexandra protested just for a second aunty lets see who it is he said dill and i took another window a crowd of men was standing around atticus they all seemed to be talking at once movin him to the county jail tomorrow mr tate was saying i dont look for any trouble but i cant guarantee there wont be any dont be foolish heck atticus said this is maycomb said i was just uneasy heck weve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure theres nothing to be uneasy about this is saturday atticus said trialll probably be monday you can keep him one night cant you i dont think anybody in maycombll begrudge me a client with times this hard there was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when mr link deas said nobody around heres up to anything its that old sarum bunch im worried about cant you get awhat is it heck change of venue said mr tate not much point in that now is it atticus said something inaudible i turned to jem who waved me to silence besides atticus was saying youre not scared of that crowd are you know how they do when they get shinnied up they dont usually drink on sunday they go to church most of the day atticus said this is a special occasion though someone said they murmured and buzzed until aunty said if jem didnt turn on the livingroom lights he would disgrace the family jem didnt hear her dont see why you touched it in the first place mr link deas was saying youve got everything to lose from this atticus i mean everything do you really think so this was atticuss dangerous question do you really think you want to move there scout bam bam bam and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men do you really think that son then read this jem would struggle the rest of an evening through the speeches of henry w grady link that boy might go to the chair but hes not going till the truths told atticuss voice was even and you know what the truth is there was a murmur among the group of men made more ominous when atticus moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him suddenly jem screamed atticus the telephones ringing the men jumped a little and scattered they were people we saw every day merchants intown farmers dr reynolds was there so was mr avery well answer it son called atticus laughter broke them up when atticus switched on the overhead light in the livingroom he found jem at the window pale except for the vivid mark of the screen on his nose why on earth are you all sitting in the dark he asked jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper i sometimes think atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind the mobile register the birmingham news and the montgomery advertiser they were after you werent they jem went to him they wanted to get you didnt they atticus lowered the paper and gazed at jem what have you been reading he asked then he said gently no son those were our friends it wasnt aa gang jem was looking from the corners of his eyes atticus tried to stifle a smile but didnt make it no we dont have mobs and that nonsense in maycomb ive never heard of a gang in maycomb ku klux got after some catholics one time never heard of any catholics in maycomb either said atticus youre confusing that with something else way back about nineteentwenty there was a klan but it was a political organization more than anything besides they couldnt find anybody to scare they paraded by mr sam levys house one night but sam just stood on his porch and told em things had come to a pretty pass hed sold em the very sheets on their backs sam made em so ashamed of themselves they went away the levy family met all criteria for being fine folks they did the best they could with the sense they had and they had been living on the same plot of ground in maycomb for five generations the ku kluxs gone said atticus itll never come back i walked home with dill and returned in time to overhear atticus saying to aunty in favor of southern womanhood as much as anybody but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life a pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussing again i sought jem and found him in his room on the bed deep in thought have they been at it i asked sort of she wont let him alone about tom robinson she almost said atticus was disgracin the family scout im scared scareda what scared about atticus somebody might hurt him jem preferred to remain mysterious all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone next day was sunday in the interval between sunday school and church when the congregation stretched its legs i saw atticus standing in the yard with another knot of men mr heck tate was present and i wondered if he had seen the light he never went to church even mr underwood was there mr underwood had no use for any organization but the maycomb tribune of which he was the sole owner editor and printer his days were spent at his linotype where he refreshed himself occasionally from an everpresent gallon jug of cherry wine he rarely gathered news people brought it to him it was said that he made up every edition of the maycomb tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype this was believable something must have been up to haul mr underwood out i caught atticus coming in the door and he said that theyd moved tom robinson to the maycomb jail he also said more to himself than to me that if theyd kept him there in the first place there wouldnt have been any fuss i watched him take his seat on the third row from the front and i heard him rumble nearer my god to thee some notes behind the rest of us he never sat with aunty jem and me he liked to be by himself in church the fake peace that prevailed on sundays was made more irritating by aunt alexandras presence atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner where if we sometimes looked in on him we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading aunt alexandra composed herself for a twohour nap and dared us to make any noise in the yard the neighborhood was resting jem in his old age had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines so dill and i spent our sundays creeping around in deers pasture shooting on sundays was prohibited so dill and i kicked jems football around the pasture for a while which was no fun dill asked if id like to have a poke at boo radley i said i didnt think itd be nice to bother him and spent the rest of the afternoon filling dill in on last winters events he was considerably impressed we parted at suppertime and after our meal jem and i were settling down to a routine evening when atticus did something that interested us he came into the livingroom carrying a long electrical extension cord there was a light bulb on the end im going out for a while he said you folksll be in bed when i come back so ill say good night now with that he put his hat on and went out the back door hes takin the car said jem our father had a few peculiarities one was he never ate desserts another was that he liked to walk as far back as i could remember there was always a chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse and atticus put many miles on it in business trips but in maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day covering about two miles he said his only exercise was walking in maycomb if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind it was correct to believe ones mind incapable of definite purpose later on i bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when i heard jem rattling around in his room his gotobed noises were so familiar to me that i knocked on his door why aint you going to bed im goin downtown for a while he was changing his pants why its almost ten oclock jem he knew it but he was going anyway then im goin with you if you say no youre not im goin anyway hear jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home and i suppose he thought a fight would antagonize aunty so he gave in with little grace i dressed quickly we waited until auntys light went out and we walked quietly down the back steps there was no moon tonight dillll wanta come i whispered so he will said jem gloomily we leaped over the driveway wall cut through miss rachels side yard and went to dills window jem whistled bobwhite dills face appeared at the screen disappeared and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out an old campaigner he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk whats up jems got the lookarounds an affliction calpurnia said all boys caught at his age ive just got this feeling jem said just this feeling we went by mrs duboses house standing empty and shuttered her camellias grown up in weeds and johnson grass there were eight more houses to the post office corner the south side of the square was deserted giant monkeypuzzle bushes bristled on each corner and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street lights a light shone in the county toilet otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark a larger square of stores surrounded the courthouse square dim lights burned from deep within them atticuss office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice but after several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the maycomb bank building when we rounded the corner of the square we saw the car parked in front of the bank hes in there said jem but he wasnt his office was reached by a long hallway looking down the hall we should have seen atticus finch attorneyatlaw in small sober letters against the light from behind his door it was dark jem peered in the bank door to make sure he turned the knob the door was locked lets go up the street maybe hes visitin mr underwood mr underwood not only ran the maycomb tribune office he lived in it that is above it he covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairs window the office building was on the northwest corner of the square and to reach it we had to pass the jail the maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the countys buildings atticus said it was like something cousin joshua st clair might have designed it was certainly someones dream starkly out of place in a town of squarefaced stores and steeproofed houses the maycomb jail was a miniature gothic joke one cell wide and two cells high complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows it stood on no lonely hill but was wedged between tyndals hardware store and the maycomb tribune office the jail was maycombs only conversation piece its detractors said it looked like a victorian privy its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers as we walked up the sidewalk we saw a solitary light burning in the distance thats funny said jem jail doesnt have an outside light looks like its over the door said dill a long extension cord ran between the bars of a secondfloor window and down the side of the building in the light from its bare bulb atticus was sitting propped against the front door he was sitting in one of his office chairs and he was reading oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over his head i made to run but jem caught me dont go to him he said he might not like it hes all right lets go home i just wanted to see where he was we were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from the meridian highway moving slowly in a line they went around the square passed the bank building and stopped in front of the jail nobody got out we saw atticus look up from his newspaper he closed it folded it deliberately dropped it in his lap and pushed his hat to the back of his head he seemed to be expecting them come on whispered jem we streaked across the square across the street until we were in the shelter of the jitney jungle door jem peeked up the sidewalk we can get closer he said we ran to tyndals hardware doornear enough at the same time discreet in ones and twos men got out of the cars shadows became substance as lights revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door atticus remained where he was the men hid him from view he in there mr finch a man said he is we heard atticus answer and hes asleep dont wake him up in obedience to my father there followed what i later realized was a sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation the men talked in nearwhispers you know what we want another man said get aside from the door mr finch you can turn around and go home again walter atticus said pleasantly heck tates around somewhere the hell he is said another man hecks bunchs so deep in the woods they wont get out till mornin indeed why so called em off on a snipe hunt was the succinct answer didnt you think athat mr finch thought about it but didnt believe it well then my fathers voice was still the same that changes things doesnt it it do another deep voice said its owner was a shadow do you really think so this was the second time i heard atticus ask that question in two days and it meant somebodys man would get jumped this was too good to miss i broke away from jem and ran as fast as i could to atticus jem shrieked and tried to catch me but i had a lead on him and dill i pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light hey atticus i thought he would have a fine surprise but his face killed my joy a flash of plain fear was going out of his eyes but returned when dill and jem wriggled into the light there was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about and when i glanced around i discovered that these men were strangers they were not the people i saw last night hot embarrassment shot through me i had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people i had never seen before atticus got up from his chair but he was moving slowly like an old man he put the newspaper down very carefully adjusting its creases with lingering fingers they were trembling a little go home jem he said take scout and dill home we were accustomed to prompt if not always cheerful acquiescence to atticuss instructions but from the way he stood jem was not thinking of budging go home i said jem shook his head as atticuss fists went to his hips so did jems and as they faced each other i could see little resemblance between them jems soft brown hair and eyes his oval face and snugfitting ears were our mothers contrasting oddly with atticuss graying black hair and squarecut features but they were somehow alike mutual defiance made them alike son i said go home jem shook his head ill send him home a burly man said and grabbed jem roughly by the collar he yanked jem nearly off his feet dont you touch him i kicked the man swiftly barefooted i was surprised to see him fall back in real pain i intended to kick his shin but aimed too high thatll do scout atticus put his hand on my shoulder dont kick folks no he said as i was pleading justification aint nobody gonna do jem that way i said all right mr finch get em outa here someone growled you got fifteen seconds to get em outa here in the midst of this strange assembly atticus stood trying to make jem mind him i aint going was his steady answer to atticuss threats requests and finally please jem take them home i was getting a bit tired of that but felt jem had his own reasons for doing as he did in view of his prospects once atticus did get him home i looked around the crowd it was a summers night but the men were dressed most of them in overalls and denim shirts buttoned up to the collars i thought they must be coldnatured as their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs some wore hats pulled firmly down over their ears they were sullenlooking sleepyeyed men who seemed unused to late hours i sought once more for a familiar face and at the center of the semicircle i found one hey mr cunningham the man did not hear me it seemed hey mr cunningham hows your entailment gettin along mr walter cunninghams legal affairs were well known to me atticus had once described them at length the big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his overall straps he seemed uncomfortable he cleared his throat and looked away my friendly overture had fallen flat mr cunningham wore no hat and the top half of his forehead was white in contrast to his sunscorched face which led me to believe that he wore one most days he shifted his feet clad in heavy work shoes dont you remember me mr cunningham im jean louise finch you brought us some hickory nuts one time remember i began to sense the futility one feels when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance i go to school with walter i began again hes your boy aint he aint he sir mr cunningham was moved to a faint nod he did know me after all hes in my grade i said and he does right well hes a good boy i added a real nice boy we brought him home for dinner one time maybe he told you about me i beat him up one time but he was real nice about it tell him hey for me wont you atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in not about what you were interested in mr cunningham displayed no interest in his son so i tackled his entailment once more in a lastditch effort to make him feel at home entailments are bad i was advising him when i slowly awoke to the fact that i was addressing the entire aggregation the men were all looking at me some had their mouths halfopen atticus had stopped poking at jem they were standing together beside dill their attention amounted to fascination atticuss mouth even was halfopen an attitude he had once described as uncouth our eyes met and he shut it well atticus i was just sayin to mr cunningham that entailments are bad an all that but you said not to worry it takes a long time sometimes that you alld ride it out together i was slowly drying up wondering what idiocy i had committed entailments seemed all right enough for livingroom talk i began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair i could stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me they were quite still whats the matter i asked atticus said nothing i looked around and up at mr cunningham whose face was equally impassive then he did a peculiar thing he squatted down and took me by both shoulders ill tell him you said hey little lady he said then he straightened up and waved a big paw lets clear out he called lets get going boys as they had come in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle cars doors slammed engines coughed and they were gone i turned to atticus but atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with his face to the wall i went to him and pulled his sleeve can we go home now he nodded produced his handkerchief gave his face a goingover and blew his nose violently mr finch a soft husky voice came from the darkness above they gone atticus stepped back and looked up theyve gone he said get some sleep tom they wont bother you any more from a different direction another voice cut crisply through the night youre damn tootin they wont had you covered all the time atticus mr underwood and a doublebarreled shotgun were leaning out his window above the maycomb tribune office it was long past my bedtime and i was growing quite tired it seemed that atticus and mr underwood would talk for the rest of the night mr underwood out the window and atticus up at him finally atticus returned switched off the light above the jail door and picked up his chair can i carry it for you mr finch asked dill he had not said a word the whole time why thank you son walking toward the office dill and i fell into step behind atticus and jem dill was encumbered by the chair and his pace was slower atticus and jem were well ahead of us and i assumed that atticus was giving him hell for not going home but i was wrong as they passed under a streetlight atticus reached out and massaged jems hair his one gesture of affection jem heard me he thrust his head around the connecting door as he came to my bed atticuss light flashed on we stayed where we were until it went off we heard him turn over and we waited until he was still again jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him try to go to sleep he said itll be all over after tomorrow maybe we had come in quietly so as not to wake aunty atticus killed the engine in the driveway and coasted to the carhouse we went in the back door and to our rooms without a word i was very tired and was drifting into sleep when the memory of atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became atticus standing in the middle of an empty waiting street pushing up his glasses the full meaning of the nights events hit me and i began crying jem was awfully nice about it for once he didnt remind me that people nearly nine years old didnt do things like that everybodys appetite was delicate this morning except jems he ate his way through three eggs atticus watched in frank admiration aunt alexandra sipped coffee and radiated waves of disapproval children who slipped out at night were a disgrace to the family atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along but aunty said nonsense mr underwood was there all the time you know its a funny thing about braxton said atticus he despises negroes wont have one near him local opinion held mr underwood to be an intense profane little man whose father in a fey fit of humor christened braxton bragg a name mr underwood had done his best to live down atticus said naming people after confederate generals made slow steady drinkers calpurnia was serving aunt alexandra more coffee and she shook her head at what i thought was a pleading winning look youre still too little she said ill tell you when you aint i said it might help my stomach all right she said and got a cup from the sideboard she poured one tablespoonful of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk i thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it and looked up to catch auntys warning frown but she was frowning at atticus she waited until calpurnia was in the kitchen then she said dont talk like that in front of them talk like what in front of whom he asked like that in front of calpurnia you said braxton underwood despises negroes right in front of her well im sure cal knows it everybody in maycomb knows it i was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days that came out when he talked with aunt alexandra it was a quiet digging in never outright irritation there was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said anything fit to say at the tables fit to say in front of calpurnia she knows what she means to this family i dont think its a good habit atticus it encourages them you know how they talk among themselves every thing that happens in this towns out to the quarters before sundown my father put down his knife i dont know of any law that says they cant talk maybe if we didnt give them so much to talk about theyd be quiet why dont you drink your coffee scout i was playing in it with the spoon i thought mr cunningham was a friend of ours you told me a long time ago he was he still is but last night he wanted to hurt you atticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside mr cunninghams basically a good man he said he just has his blind spots along with the rest of us jem spoke dont call that a blind spot heda killed you last night when he first went there he might have hurt me a little atticus conceded but son youll understand folks a little better when youre older a mobs always made up of people no matter what mr cunningham was part of a mob last night but he was still a man every mob in every little southern town is always made up of people you knowdoesnt say much for them does it ill say not said jem so it took an eightyearold child to bring em to their senses didnt it said atticus that proves somethingthat a gang of wild animals can be stopped simply because theyre still human hmp maybe we need a police force of children you children last night made walter cunningham stand in my shoes for a minute that was enough well i hoped jem would understand folks a little better when he was older i wouldnt first day walter comes back to schoolll be his last i affirmed you will not touch him atticus said flatly i dont want either of you bearing a grudge about this thing no matter what happens you see dont you said aunt alexandra what comes of things like this dont say i havent told you atticus said hed never say that pushed out his chair and got up theres a day ahead so excuse me jem i dont want you and scout downtown today please as atticus departed dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom its all over town this morning he announced all about how we held off a hundred folks with our bare hands aunt alexandra stared him to silence it was not a hundred folks she said and nobody held anybody off it was just a nest of those cunninghams drunk and disorderly aw aunty thats just dills way said jem he signaled us to follow him you all stay in the yard today she said as we made our way to the front porch it was like saturday people from the south end of the county passed our house in a leisurely but steady stream mr dolphus raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred dont see how he stays in the saddle murmured jem how cn you stand to get drunk fore eight in the morning a wagonload of ladies rattled past us they wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses with long sleeves a bearded man in a wool hat drove them yonders some mennonites jem said to dill they dont have buttons they lived deep in the woods did most of their trading across the river and rarely came to maycomb dill was interested theyve all got blue eyes jem explained and the men cant shave after they marry their wives like for em to tickle em with their beards mr x billups rode by on a mule and waved to us hes a funny man said jem xs his name not his initial he was in court one time and they asked him his name he said x billups clerk asked him to spell it and he said x asked him again and he said x they kept at it till he wrote x on a sheet of paper and held it up for everybody to see they asked him where he got his name and he said thats the way his folks signed him up when he was born as the county went by us jem gave dill the histories and general attitudes of the more prominent figures mr tensaw jones voted the straight prohibition ticket miss emily davis dipped snuff in private mr byron waller could play the violin mr jake slade was cutting his third set of teeth a wagonload of unusually sternfaced citizens appeared when they pointed to miss maudie atkinsons yard ablaze with summer flowers miss maudie herself came out on the porch there was an odd thing about miss maudieon her porch she was too far away for us to see her features clearly but we could always catch her mood by the way she stood she was now standing arms akimbo her shoulders drooping a little her head cocked to one side her glasses winking in the sunlight we knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness the driver of the wagon slowed down his mules and a shrillvoiced woman called out he that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness miss maudie answered a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance i guess that the footwashers thought that the devil was quoting scripture for his own purposes as the driver speeded his mules why they objected to miss maudies yard was a mystery heightened in my mind because for someone who spent all the daylight hours outdoors miss maudies command of scripture was formidable you goin to court this morning asked jem we had strolled over i am not she said i have no business with the court this morning arent you goin down to watch asked dill i am not ts morbid watching a poor devil on trial for his life look at all those folks its like a roman carnival they hafta try him in public miss maudie i said wouldnt be right if they didnt im quite aware of that she said just because its public i dont have to go do i miss stephanie crawford came by she wore a hat and gloves um um um she said look at all those folksyoud think william jennings bryan was speakin and where are you going stephanie inquired miss maudie to the jitney jungle miss maudie said shed never seen miss stephanie go to the jitney jungle in a hat in her life well said miss stephanie i thought i might just look in at the courthouse to see what atticuss up to better be careful he doesnt hand you a subpoena we asked miss maudie to elucidate she said miss stephanie seemed to know so much about the case she might as well be called on to testify we held off until noon when atticus came home to dinner and said theyd spent the morning picking the jury after dinner we stopped by for dill and went to town it was a gala occasion there was no room at the public hitching rail for another animal mules and wagons were parked under every available tree the courthouse square was covered with picnic parties sitting on newspapers washing down biscuit and syrup with warm milk from fruit jars some people were gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chops the more affluent chased their food with drugstore cocacola in bulbshaped soda glasses greasyfaced children poppedthewhip through the crowd and babies lunched at their mothers breasts in a far corner of the square the negroes sat quietly in the sun dining on sardines crackers and the more vivid flavors of nehi cola mr dolphus raymond sat with them jem said dill hes drinkin out of a sack mr dolphus raymond seemed to be so doing two yellow drugstore straws ran from his mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag aint ever seen anybody do that murmured dill how does he keep whats in it in it jem giggled hes got a cocola bottle full of whiskey in there thats sos not to upset the ladies youll see him sip it all afternoon hell step out for a while and fill it back up whys he sittin with the colored folks always does he likes em bettern he likes us i reckon lives by himself way down near the county line hes got a colored woman and all sorts of mixed chillun show you some of em if we see em he doesnt look like trash said dill hes not he owns all one side of the riverbank down there and hes from a real old family to boot then why does he do like that thats just his way said jem they say he never got over his weddin he was supposed to marry one of thethe spencer ladies i think they were gonna have a huge weddin but they didntafter the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew her head off shotgun she pulled the trigger with her toes did they ever know why no said jem nobody ever knew quite why but mr dolphus they said it was because she found out about his colored woman he reckoned he could keep her and get married too hes been sorta drunk ever since you know though hes real good to those chillun jem i asked whats a mixed child half white half colored youve seen em scout you know that redkinkyheaded one that delivers for the drugstore hes half white theyre real sad sad how come they dont belong anywhere colored folks wont have em because theyre half white white folks wont have em cause theyre colored so theyre just inbetweens dont belong anywhere but mr dolphus now they say hes shipped two of his up north they dont mind em up north yonders one of em a small boy clutching a negro womans hand walked toward us he looked all negro to me he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth sometimes he would skip happily and the negro woman tugged his hand to make him stop jem waited until they passed us thats one of the little ones he said how can you tell asked dill he looked black to me you cant sometimes not unless you know who they are but hes half raymond all right but how can you tell i asked i told you scout you just hafta know who they are well how do you know we aint negroes uncle jack finch says we really dont know he says as far as he can trace back the finches we aint but for all he knows we mighta come straight out of ethiopia durin the old testament well if we came out durin the old testament its too long ago to matter thats what i thought said jem but around here once you have a drop of negro blood that makes you all black hey look some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits of newspaper cellophane and wrapping paper children came to mothers babies were cradled on hips as men in sweatstained hats collected their families and herded them through the courthouse doors in the far corner of the square the negroes and mr dolphus raymond stood up and dusted their breeches there were few women and children among them which seemed to dispel the holiday mood they waited patiently at the doors behind the white families lets go in said dill naw we better wait till they get in atticus might not like it if he sees us said jem the maycomb county courthouse was faintly reminiscent of arlington in one respect the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light burden the pillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in another courthouse was built around them it is better to say built in spite of them but for the south porch the maycomb county courthouse was early victorian presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north from the other side however greek revival columns clashed with a big nineteenthcentury clock tower housing a rusty unreliable instrument a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past to reach the courtroom on the second floor one passed sundry sunless county cubbyholes the tax assessor the tax collector the county clerk the county solicitor the circuit clerk the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that smelled of decaying record books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine it was necessary to turn on the lights in the daytime there was always a film of dust on the rough floorboards the inhabitants of these offices were creatures of their environment little grayfaced men they seemed untouched by wind or sun we knew there was a crowd but we had not bargained for the multitudes in the firstfloor hallway i got separated from jem and dill but made my way toward the wall by the stairwell knowing jem would come for me eventually i found myself in the middle of the idlers club and made myself as unobtrusive as possible this was a group of whiteshirted khakitrousered suspendered old men who had spent their lives doing nothing and passed their twilight days doing same on pine benches under the live oaks on the square attentive critics of courthouse business atticus said they knew as much law as the chief justice from long years of observation normally they were the courts only spectators and today they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine when they spoke their voices sounded casually important the conversation was about my father thinks he knows what hes doing one said ohh now i wouldnt say that said another atticus finchs a deep reader a mighty deep reader he reads all right thats all he does the club snickered lemme tell you somethin now billy a third said you know the court appointed him to defend this nigger yeah but atticus aims to defend him thats what i dont like about it this was news news that put a different light on things atticus had to whether he wanted to or not i thought it odd that he hadnt said anything to us about itwe could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves he had to thats why he was doing it equaled fewer fights and less fussing but did that explain the towns attitude the court appointed atticus to defend him atticus aimed to defend him thats what they didnt like about it it was confusing the negroes having waited for the white people to go upstairs began to come in whoa now just a minute said a club member holding up his walking stick just dont start up them there stairs yet awhile the club began its stiffjointed climb and ran into dill and jem on their way down looking for me they squeezed past and jem called scout come on there aint a seat left well hafta stand up looka there now he said irritably as the black people surged upstairs the old men ahead of them would take most of the standing room we were out of luck and it was my fault jem informed me we stood miserably by the wall cant you all get in reverend sykes was looking down at us black hat in hand hey reverend said jem naw scout here messed us up well lets see what we can do reverend sykes edged his way upstairs in a few moments he was back theres not a seat downstairs do you all reckon itll be all right if you all came to the balcony with me gosh yes said jem happily we sped ahead of reverend sykes to the courtroom floor there we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door reverend sykes came puffing behind us and steered us gently through the black people in the balcony four negroes rose and gave us their frontrow seats the colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a secondstory veranda and from it we could see everything the jury sat to the left under long windows sunburned lanky they seemed to be all farmers but this was natural townfolk rarely sat on juries they were either struck or excused one or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressedup cunninghams at this stage they sat straight and alert the circuit solicitor and another man atticus and tom robinson sat at tables with their backs to us there was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the solicitors table atticuss was bare just inside the railing that divided the spectators from the court the witnesses sat on cowhidebottomed chairs their backs were to us judge taylor was on the bench looking like a sleepy old shark his pilot fish writing rapidly below in front of him judge taylor looked like most judges i had ever seen amiable whitehaired slightly ruddyfaced he was a man who ran his court with an alarming informality he sometimes propped his feet up he often cleaned his fingernails with his pocket knife in long equity hearings especially after dinner he gave the impression of dozing an impression dispelled forever when a lawyer once deliberately pushed a pile of books to the floor in a desperate effort to wake him up without opening his eyes judge taylor murmured mr whitley do that again and itll cost you one hundred dollars he was a man learned in the law and although he seemed to take his job casually in reality he kept a firm grip on any proceedings that came before him only once was judge taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court and the cunninghams stopped him old sarum their stamping grounds was populated by two families separate and apart in the beginning but unfortunately bearing the same name the cunninghams married the coninghams until the spelling of the names was academicacademic until a cunningham disputed a coningham over land titles and took to the law during a controversy of this character jeems cunningham testified that his mother spelled it cunningham on deeds and things but she was really a coningham she was an uncertain speller a seldom reader and was given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front gallery in the evening after nine hours of listening to the eccentricities of old sarums inhabitants judge taylor threw the case out of court when asked upon what grounds judge taylor said champertous connivance and declared he hoped to god the litigants were satisfied by each having had their public say they were that was all they had wanted in the first place judge taylor had one interesting habit he permitted smoking in his courtroom but did not himself indulge sometimes if one was lucky one had the privilege of watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up bit by bit the dead cigar would disappear to reappear some hours later as a flat slick mess its essence extracted and mingling with judge taylors digestive juices i once asked atticus how mrs taylor stood to kiss him but atticus said they didnt kiss much the witness stand was to the right of judge taylor and when we got to our seats mr heck tate was already on it jem i said are those the ewells sittin down yonder hush said jem mr heck tates testifyin mr tate had dressed for the occasion he wore an ordinary business suit which made him look somehow like every other man gone were his high boots lumber jacket and bulletstudded belt from that moment he ceased to terrify me he was sitting forward in the witness chair his hands clasped between his knees listening attentively to the circuit solicitor the solicitor a mr gilmer was not well known to us he was from abbottsville we saw him only when court convened and that rarely for court was of no special interest to jem and me a balding smoothfaced man he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty although his back was to us we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eyes which he used to his advantage he seemed to be looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind thus he was hell on juries and witnesses the jury thinking themselves under close scrutiny paid attention so did the witnesses thinking likewise in your own words mr tate mr gilmer was saying well said mr tate touching his glasses and speaking to his knees i was called could you say it to the jury mr tate thank you who called you mr tate said i was fetched by bobby mr bob ewell yonder one night what night sir mr tate said it was the night of november twentyfirst i was just leaving my office to go home when bmr ewell came in very excited he was and said get out to his house quick some niggerd raped his girl did you go certainly got in the car and went out as fast as i could and what did you find found her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room one on the right as you go in she was pretty well beat up but i heaved her to her feet and she washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she was all right i asked her who hurt her and she said it was tom robinson judge taylor who had been concentrating on his fingernails looked up as if he were expecting an objection but atticus was quiet asked her if he beat her like that she said yes he had asked her if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did so i went down to robinsons house and brought him back she identified him as the one so i took him in thats all there was to it thank you said mr gilmer judge taylor said any questions atticus yes said my father he was sitting behind his table his chair was skewed to one side his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the back of his chair did you call a doctor sheriff did anybody call a doctor asked atticus no sir said mr tate didnt call a doctor no sir repeated mr tate why not there was an edge to atticuss voice well i can tell you why i didnt it wasnt necessary mr finch she was mighty banged up something sho happened it was obvious but you didnt call a doctor while you were there did anyone send for one fetch one carry her to one no sir judge taylor broke in hes answered the question three times atticus he didnt call a doctor atticus said i just wanted to make sure judge and the judge smiled jems hand which was resting on the balcony rail tightened around it he drew in his breath suddenly glancing below i saw no corresponding reaction and wondered if jem was trying to be dramatic dill was watching peacefully and so was reverend sykes beside him what is it i whispered and got a terse shh sheriff atticus was saying you say she was mighty banged up in what way well just describe her injuries heck well she was beaten around the head there was already bruises comin on her arms and it happened about thirty minutes before how do you know mr tate grinned sorry thats what they said anyway she was pretty bruised up when i got there and she had a black eye comin which eye mr tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair lets see he said softly then he looked at atticus as if he considered the question childish cant you remember atticus asked mr tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him and said her left wait a minute sheriff said atticus was it her left facing you or her left looking the same way you were mr tate said oh yes thatd make it her right it was her right eye mr finch i remember now she was bunged up on that side of her face mr tate blinked again as if something had suddenly been made plain to him then he turned his head and looked around at tom robinson as if by instinct tom robinson raised his head something had been made plain to atticus also and it brought him to his feet sheriff please repeat what you said it was her right eye i said no atticus walked to the court reporters desk and bent down to the furiously scribbling hand it stopped flipped back the shorthand pad and the court reporter said mr finch i remember now she was bunged up on that side of the face atticus looked up at mr tate which side again heck the right side mr finch but she had more bruisesyou wanta hear about em atticus seemed to be bordering on another question but he thought better of it and said yes what were her other injuries as mr tate answered atticus turned and looked at tom robinson as if to say this was something they hadnt bargained for her arms were bruised and she showed me her neck there were definite finger marks on her gullet all around her throat at the back of her neck id say they were all around mr finch you would yes sir she had a small throat anybody coulda reached around it with just answer the question yes or no please sheriff said atticus dryly and mr tate fell silent atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor who shook his head at the judge who nodded to mr tate who rose stiffly and stepped down from the witness stand below us heads turned feet scraped the floor babies were shifted to shoulders and a few children scampered out of the courtroom the negroes behind us whispered softly among themselves dill was asking reverend sykes what it was all about but reverend sykes said he didnt know so far things were utterly dull nobody had thundered there were no arguments between opposing counsel there was no drama a grave disappointment to all present it seemed atticus was proceeding amiably as if he were involved in a title dispute with his infinite capacity for calming turbulent seas he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells of sleepyeyed sullen men of a husky voice calling in the night mr finch they gone our nightmare had gone with daylight everything would come out all right all the spectators were as relaxed as judge taylor except jem his mouth was twisted into a purposeful halfgrin and his eyes happy about and he said something about corroborating evidence which made me sure he was showing off robert e lee ewell in answer to the clerks booming voice a little bantam cock of a man rose and strutted to the stand the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name when he turned around to take the oath we saw that his face was as red as his neck we also saw no resemblance to his namesake a shock of wispy newwashed hair stood up from his forehead his nose was thin pointed and shiny he had no chin to speak ofit seemed to be part of his crepey neck so help me god he crowed every town the size of maycomb had families like the ewells no economic fluctuations changed their statuspeople like the ewells lived as guests of the county in prosperity as well as in the depths of a depression no truant officers could keep their numerous offspring in school no public health officer could free them from congenital defects various worms and the diseases indigenous to filthy surroundings maycombs ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a negro cabin the cabins plank walls were supplemented with sheets of corrugated iron its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat so only its general shape suggested its original design square with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone its windows were merely open spaces in the walls which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on maycombs refuse the varmints had a lean time of it for the ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day and the fruits of their industry those that were not eaten made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child what passed for a fence was bits of treelimbs broomsticks and tool shafts all tipped with rusty hammerheads snaggletoothed rake heads shovels axes and grubbing hoes held on with pieces of barbed wire enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing the remains of a modelt ford on blocks a discarded dentists chair an ancient icebox plus lesser items old shoes wornout table radios picture frames and fruit jars under which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully one corner of the yard though bewildered maycomb against the fence in a line were six chippedenamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums cared for as tenderly as if they belonged to miss maudie atkinson had miss maudie deigned to permit a geranium on her premises people said they were mayella ewells nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place some people said six others said nine there were always several dirtyfaced ones at the windows when anyone passed by nobody had occasion to pass by except at christmas when the churches delivered baskets and when the mayor of maycomb asked us to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash atticus took us with him last christmas when he complied with the mayors request a dirt road ran from the highway past the dump down to a small negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the ewells it was necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around most people turned around in the negroes front yards in the frosty december dusk their cabins looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing amber from the fires inside there were delicious smells about chicken bacon frying crisp as the twilight air jem and i detected squirrel cooking but it took an old countryman like atticus to identify possum and rabbit aromas that vanished when we rode back past the ewell residence all the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearest neighbors was that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water his skin was white mr robert ewell asked mr gilmer thats mname capn said the witness mr gilmers back stiffened a little and i felt sorry for him perhaps id better explain something now ive heard that lawyers children on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument get the wrong idea they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemies of their parents they suffer agonies and are surprised to see them often go out arminarm with their tormenters during the first recess this was not true of jem and me we acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose im sorry that i cant provide any drama in this respect if i did it would not be true we could tell however when debate became more acrimonious than professional but this was from watching lawyers other than our father i never heard atticus raise his voice in my life except to a deaf witness mr gilmer was doing his job as atticus was doing his besides mr ewell was mr gilmers witness and he had no business being rude to him of all people are you the father of mayella ewell was the next question well if i aint i cant do nothing about it now her mas dead was the answer judge taylor stirred he turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at the witness are you the father of mayella ewell he asked in a way that made the laughter below us stop suddenly yes sir mr ewell said meekly judge taylor went on in tones of good will this the first time youve ever been in court i dont recall ever seeing you here at the witnesss affirmative nod he continued well lets get something straight there will be no more audibly obscene speculations on any subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as im sitting here do you understand mr ewell nodded but i dont think he did judge taylor sighed and said all right mr gilmer thank you sir mr ewell would you tell us in your own words what happened on the evening of november twentyfirst please jem grinned and pushed his hair back justinyourown words was mr gilmers trademark we often wondered who elses words mr gilmer was afraid his witness might employ well the night of november twentyone i was comin in from the woods with a load okindlin and just as i got to the fence i heard mayella screamin like a stuck hog inside the house here judge taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided his speculations devoid of evil intent for he subsided sleepily what time was it mr ewell just fore sundown well i was sayin mayella was screamin fit to beat jesus another glance from the bench silenced mr ewell yes she was screaming said mr gilmer mr ewell looked confusedly at the judge well mayella was raisin this holy racket so i dropped mload and run as fast as i could but i run into th fence but when i got distangled i run up to th window and i seen mr ewells face grew scarlet he stood up and pointed his finger at tom robinson i seen that black nigger yonder ruttin on my mayella so serene was judge taylors court that he had few occasions to use his gavel but he hammered fully five minutes atticus was on his feet at the bench saying something to him mr heck tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom behind us there was an angry muffled groan from the colored people reverend sykes leaned across dill and me pulling at jems elbow mr jem he said you better take miss jean louise home mr jem you hear me jem turned his head scout go home dill younscout go home you gotta make me first i said remembering atticuss blessed dictum jem scowled furiously at me then said to reverend sykes i think its okay reverend she doesnt understand it i was mortally offended i most certainly do i cn understand anything you can aw hush she doesnt understand it reverend she aint nine yet reverend sykess black eyes were anxious mr finch know you all are here this aint fit for miss jean louise or you boys either jem shook his head he cant see us this far away its all right reverend i knew jem would win because i knew nothing could make him leave now dill and i were safe for a while atticus could see us from where he was if he looked as judge taylor banged his gavel mr ewell was sitting smugly in the witness chair surveying his handiwork with one phrase he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky tense murmuring crowd being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pinkpinkpink the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil in possession of his court once more judge taylor leaned back in his chair he looked suddenly weary his age was showing and i thought about what atticus had saidhe and mrs taylor didnt kiss muchhe must have been nearly seventy there has been a request judge taylor said that this courtroom be cleared of spectators or at least of women and children a request that will be denied for the time being people generally see what they look for and hear what they listen for and they have the right to subject their children to it but i can assure you of one thing you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom but you wont leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charges mr ewell you will keep your testimony within the confines of christian english usage if that is possible proceed mr gilmer mr ewell reminded me of a deafmute i was sure he had never heard the words judge taylor directed at himhis mouth struggled silently with thembut their import registered on his face smugness faded from it replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled judge taylor not at all as long as mr ewell was on the stand the judge kept his eyes on him as if daring him to make a false move mr gilmer and atticus exchanged glances atticus was sitting down again his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face mr gilmer looked rather desperate a question from judge taylor made him relax mr ewell did you see the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter yes i did the spectators were quiet but the defendant said something atticus whispered to him and tom robinson was silent you say you were at the window asked mr gilmer yes sir how far is it from the ground bout three foot did you have a clear view of the room yes sir how did the room look well it was all slung about like there was a fight what did you do when you saw the defendant well i run around the house to get in but he run out the front door just ahead of me i sawed who he was all right i was too distracted about mayella to run afterim i run in the house and she was lyin on the floor squallin then what did you do why i run for tate quick as i could i knowed who it was all right lived down yonder in that niggernest passed the house every day jedge ive asked this county for fifteen years to clean out that nest down yonder theyre dangerous to live around sides devaluin my property thank you mr ewell said mr gilmer hurriedly the witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into atticus who had risen to question him judge taylor permitted the court to laugh just a minute sir said atticus genially could i ask you a question or two mr ewell backed up into the witness chair settled himself and regarded atticus with haughty suspicion an expression common to maycomb county witnesses when confronted by opposing counsel mr ewell atticus began folks were doing a lot of running that night lets see you say you ran to the house you ran to the window you ran inside you ran to mayella you ran for mr tate did you during all this running run for a doctor wadnt no need to i seen what happened but theres one thing i dont understand said atticus werent you concerned with mayellas condition i most positively was said mr ewell i seen who done it no i mean her physical condition did you not think the nature of her injuries warranted immediate medical attention what didnt you think she should have had a doctor immediately the witness said he never thought of it he had never called a doctor to any of hisn in his life and if he had it would have cost him five dollars that all he asked not quite said atticus casually mr ewell you heard the sheriffs testimony didnt you hows that you were in the courtroom when mr heck tate was on the stand werent you you heard everything he said didnt you mr ewell considered the matter carefully and seemed to decide that the question was safe yes he said do you agree with his description of mayellas injuries hows that atticus looked around at mr gilmer and smiled mr ewell seemed determined not to give the defense the time of day mr tate testified that her right eye was blackened that she was beaten around the oh yeah said the witness i hold with everything tate said you do asked atticus mildly i just want to make sure he went to the court reporter said something and the reporter entertained us for some minutes by reading mr tates testimony as if it were stockmarket quotations which eye her left oh yes thatd make it her right it was her right eye mr finch i remember now she was bunged he flipped the page up on that side of the face sheriff please repeat what you said it was her right eye i said thank you bert said atticus you heard it again mr ewell do you have anything to add to it do you agree with the sheriff i holds with tate her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up the little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench it was becoming evident that he thought atticus an easy match he seemed to grow ruddy again his chest swelled and once more he was a red little rooster i thought hed burst his shirt at atticuss next question mr ewell can you read and write mr gilmer interrupted objection he said cant see what witnesss literacy has to do with the case irrelevantnimmaterial judge taylor was about to speak but atticus said judge if youll allow the question plus another one youll soon see all right lets see said judge taylor but make sure we see atticus overruled mr gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the state of mr ewells education had on the case ill repeat the question said atticus can you read and write i most positively can will you write your name and show us i most positively will how do you think i sign my relief checks mr ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens the whispers and chuckles below us probably had to do with what a card he was i was becoming nervous atticus seemed to know what he was doingbut it seemed to me that hed gone frogsticking without a light never never never on crossexamination ask a witness a question you dont already know the answer to was a tenet i absorbed with my babyfood do it and youll often get an answer you dont want an answer that might wreck your case atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat he drew out an envelope then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen he moved leisurely and had turned so that he was in full view of the jury he unscrewed the fountainpen cap and placed it gently on his table he shook the pen a little then handed it with the envelope to the witness would you write your name for us he asked clearly now so the jury can see you do it mr ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see judge taylor staring at him as if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witness stand to see mr gilmer halfsitting halfstanding at his table the jury was watching him one man was leaning forward with his hands over the railing whats so interestin he asked youre lefthanded mr ewell said judge taylor mr ewell turned angrily to the judge and said he didnt see what his being lefthanded had to do with it that he was a christfearing man and atticus finch was taking advantage of him tricking lawyers like atticus finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways he had told them what happened hed say it again and againwhich he did nothing atticus asked him after that shook his story that hed looked through the window then ran the nigger off then ran for the sheriff atticus finally dismissed him mr gilmer asked him one more question about your writing with your left hand are you ambidextrous mr ewell i most positively am not i can use one hand good as the other one hand good as the other he added glaring at the defense table jem seemed to be having a quiet fit he was pounding the balcony rail softly and once he whispered weve got him i didnt think so atticus was trying to show it seemed to me that mr ewell could have beaten up mayella that much i could follow if her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face it would tend to show that a lefthanded person did it sherlock holmes and jem finch would agree but tom robinson could easily be lefthanded too like mr heck tate i imagined a person facing me went through a swift mental pantomime and concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left i looked down at him his back was to us but i could see his broad shoulders and bullthick neck he could easily have done it i thought jem was counting his chickens but someone was booming again mayella violet ewell a young girl walked to the witness stand as she raised her hand and swore that the evidence she gave would be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her god she seemed somehow fragilelooking but when she sat facing us in the witness chair she became what she was a thickbodied girl accustomed to strenuous labor in maycomb county it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly as opposed to yearly lavations mr ewell had a scalded look as if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layers of dirt his skin appeared to be sensitive to the elements mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean and i was reminded of the row of red geraniums in the ewell yard mr gilmer asked mayella to tell the jury in her own words what happened on the evening of november twentyfirst of last year just in her own words please mayella sat silently where were you at dusk on that evening began mr gilmer patiently on the porch which porch aint but one the front porch what were you doing on the porch nothin judge taylor said just tell us what happened you can do that cant you mayella stared at him and burst into tears she covered her mouth with her hands and sobbed judge taylor let her cry for a while then he said thats enough now dont be fraid of anybody here as long as you tell the truth all this is strange to you i know but youve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear what are you scared of mayella said something behind her hands what was that asked the judge him she sobbed pointing at atticus mr finch she nodded vigorously saying dont want him doin me like he done papa tryin to make him out lefthanded judge taylor scratched his thick white hair it was plain that he had never been confronted with a problem of this kind how old are you he asked nineteenandahalf mayella said judge taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing tones mr finch has no idea of scaring you he growled and if he did im here to stop him thats one thing im sitting up here for now youre a big girl so you just sit up straight and tell thetell us what happened to you you can do that cant you i whispered to jem has she got good sense jem was squinting down at the witness stand cant tell yet he said shes got enough sense to get the judge sorry for her but she might be justoh i dont know mollified mayella gave atticus a final terrified glance and said to mr gilmer well sir i was on the porch andand he came along and you see there was this old chiffarobe in the yard papad brought in to chop up for kindlinpapa told me to do it while he was off in the woods but i wadnt feelin strong enough then so he came by who is he mayella pointed to tom robinson ill have to ask you to be more specific please said mr gilmer the reporter cant put down gestures very well thatn yonder she said robinson then what happened i said come here nigger and bust up this chiffarobe for me i gotta nickel for you he coulda done it easy enough he could so he come in the yard an i went in the house to get him the nickel and i turned around an fore i knew it he was on me just run up behind me he did he got me round the neck cussin me an sayin dirti foughtnhollered but he had me round the neck he hit me agin an agin mr gilmer waited for mayella to collect herself she had twisted her handkerchief into a sweaty rope when she opened it to wipe her face it was a mass of creases from her hot hands she waited for mr gilmer to ask another question but when he didnt she said he chunked me on the floor an choked men took advantage of me did you scream asked mr gilmer did you scream and fight back reckon i did hollered for all i was worth kicked and hollered loud as i could then what happened i dont remember too good but next thing i knew papa was in the room astanding over me hollerin who done it who done it then i sorta fainted an the next thing i knew mr tate was pullin me up offa the floor and leadin me to the water bucket apparently mayellas recital had given her confidence but it was not her fathers brash kind there was something stealthy about hers like a steadyeyed cat with a twitchy tail you say you fought him off as hard as you could fought him tooth and nail asked mr gilmer i positively did mayella echoed her father you are positive that he took full advantage of you mayellas face contorted and i was afraid that she would cry again instead she said he done what he was after mr gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand thats all for the time being he said pleasantly but you stay there i expect big bad mr finch has some questions to ask you state will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense murmured judge taylor primly at least not at this time atticus got up grinning but instead of walking to the witness stand he opened his coat and hooked his thumbs in his vest then he walked slowly across the room to the windows he looked out but didnt seem especially interested in what he saw then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand from long years of experience i could tell he was trying to come to a decision about something miss mayella he said smiling i wont try to scare you for a while not yet lets just get acquainted how old are you said i was nineteen said it to the judge yonder mayella jerked her head resentfully at the bench so you did so you did maam youll have to bear with me miss mayella im getting along and cant remember as well as i used to i might ask you things youve already said before but youll give me an answer wont you good i could see nothing in mayellas expression to justify atticuss assumption that he had secured her wholehearted cooperation she was looking at him furiously wont answer a word you say long as you keep on mockin me she said maam asked atticus startled longs you keep on makin fun ome judge taylor said mr finch is not making fun of you whats the matter with you mayella looked from under lowered eyelids at atticus but she said to the judge longs he keeps on callin me maam an sayin miss mayella i dont hafta take his sass i aint called upon to take it atticus resumed his stroll to the windows and let judge taylor handle this one judge taylor was not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity but i did feel a pang for him as he tried to explain thats just mr finchs way he told mayella weve done business in this court for years and years and mr finch is always courteous to everybody hes not trying to mock you hes trying to be polite thats just his way the judge leaned back atticus lets get on with these proceedings and let the record show that the witness has not been sassed her views to the contrary i wondered if anybody had ever called her maam or miss mayella in her life probably not as she took offense to routine courtesy what on earth was her life like i soon found out you say youre nineteen atticus resumed how many sisters and brothers have you he walked from the windows back to the stand sebm she said and i wondered if they were all like the specimen i had seen the first day i started to school you the eldest the oldest yes how long has your mother been dead dont knowlong time did you ever go to school readnwrite good as papa yonder mayella sounded like a mr jingle in a book i had been reading how long did you go to school two yearthree yeardunno slowly but surely i began to see the pattern of atticuss questions from questions that mr gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to atticus was quietly building up before the jury a picture of the ewells home life the jury learned the following things their relief check was far from enough to feed the family and there was strong suspicion that papa drank it up anywayhe sometimes went off in the swamp for days and came home sick the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes but when it was you could make dandy ones from strips of old tires the family hauled its water in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of the dumpthey kept the surrounding area clear of trashand it was everybody for himself as far as keeping clean went if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water the younger children had perpetual colds and suffered from chronic grounditch there was a lady who came around sometimes and asked mayella why she didnt stay in schoolshe wrote down the answer with two members of the family reading and writing there was no need for the rest of them to learnpapa needed them at home miss mayella said atticus in spite of himself a nineteenyearold girl like you must have friends who are your friends the witness frowned as if puzzled friends yes dont you know anyone near your age or older or younger boys and girls just ordinary friends mayellas hostility which had subsided to grudging neutrality flared again you makin fun ome agin mr finch atticus let her question answer his do you love your father miss mayella was his next love him whatcha mean i mean is he good to you is he easy to get along with he does tollable cept when except when mayella looked at her father who was sitting with his chair tipped against the railing he sat up straight and waited for her to answer except when nothin said mayella i said he does tollable mr ewell leaned back again except when hes drinking asked atticus so gently that mayella nodded does he ever go after you how you mean when hesriled has he ever beaten you mayella looked around down at the court reporter up at the judge answer the question miss mayella said judge taylor my paws never touched a hair omy head in my life she declared firmly he never touched me atticuss glasses had slipped a little and he pushed them up on his nose weve had a good visit miss mayella and now i guess wed better get to the case you say you asked tom robinson to come chop up awhat was it a chiffarobe a old dresser full of drawers on one side was tom robinson well known to you whaddya mean i mean did you know who he was where he lived mayella nodded i knowed who he was he passed the house every day was this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence mayella jumped slightly at the question atticus was making his slow pilgrimage to the windows as he had been doing he would ask a question then look out waiting for an answer he did not see her involuntary jump but it seemed to me that he knew she had moved he turned around and raised his eyebrows was he began again yes it was didnt you ever ask him to come inside the fence before she was prepared now i did not i certainly did not one did nots enough said atticus serenely you never asked him to do odd jobs for you before i mighta conceded mayella there was several niggers around can you remember any other occasions no all right now to what happened you said tom robinson was behind you in the room when you turned around that right yes you said he got you around the neck cussing and saying dirtis that right ts right atticuss memory had suddenly become accurate you say he caught me and choked me and took advantage of meis that right thats what i said do you remember him beating you about the face the witness hesitated you seem sure enough that he choked you all this time you were fighting back remember you kicked and hollered as loud as you could do you remember him beating you about the face mayella was silent she seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself i thought for a moment she was doing mr heck tates and my trick of pretending there was a person in front of us she glanced at mr gilmer its an easy question miss mayella so ill try again do you remember him beating you about the face atticuss voice had lost its comfortableness he was speaking in his arid detached professional voice do you remember him beating you about the face no i dont recollect if he hit me i mean yes i do he hit me was your last sentence your answer huh yes he hiti just dont remember i just dont remember it all happened so quick judge taylor looked sternly at mayella dont you cry young woman he began but atticus said let her cry if she wants to judge weve got all the time in the world mayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at atticus ill answer any question you gotget me up here an mock me will you ill answer any question you got thats fine said atticus therere only a few more miss mayella not to be tedious youve testified that the defendant hit you grabbed you around the neck choked you and took advantage of you i want you to be sure you have the right man will you identify the man who raped you i will thats him right yonder atticus turned to the defendant tom stand up let miss mayella have a good long look at you is this the man miss mayella tom robinsons powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt he rose to his feet and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair he looked oddly off balance but it was not from the way he was standing his left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right and hung dead at his side it ended in a small shriveled hand and from as far away as the balcony i could see that it was no use to him scout breathed jem scout look reverend hes crippled reverend sykes leaned across me and whispered to jem he got it caught in a cotton gin caught it in mr dolphus raymonds cotton gin when he was a boy like to bled to death tore all the muscles loose from his bones atticus said is this the man who raped you it most certainly is atticuss next question was one word long how mayella was raging i dont know how he done it but he done iti said it all happened so fast i now lets consider this calmly began atticus but mr gilmer interrupted with an objection he was not irrelevant or immaterial but atticus was browbeating the witness judge taylor laughed outright oh sit down horace hes doing nothing of the sort if anything the witnesss browbeating atticus judge taylor was the only person in the courtroom who laughed even the babies were still and i suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mothers breasts now said atticus miss mayella youve testified that the defendant choked and beat youyou didnt say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you cold but you turned around and there he was atticus was back behind his table and he emphasized his words by tapping his knuckles on it do you wish to reconsider any of your testimony you want me to say something that didnt happen no maam i want you to say something that did happen tell us once more please what happened i toldja what happened you testified that you turned around and there he was he choked you then yes then he released your throat and hit you i said he did he blacked your left eye with his right fist i ducked and itit glanced thats what it did i ducked and it glanced off mayella had finally seen the light youre becoming suddenly clear on this point a while ago you couldnt remember too well could you i said he hit me all right he choked you he hit you then he raped you that right it most certainly is youre a strong girl what were you doing all the time just standing there i toldja i hollerednkickednfought atticus reached up and took off his glasses turned his good right eye to the witness and rained questions on her judge taylor said one question at a time atticus give the witness a chance to answer all right why didnt you run i tried tried to what kept you from it ihe slung me down thats what he did he slung me downn got on top of me you were screaming all this time i certainly was then why didnt the other children hear you where were they at the dump where were they no answer why didnt your screams make them come running the dumps closer than the woods isnt it no answer or didnt you scream until you saw your father in the window you didnt think to scream until then did you no answer did you scream first at your father instead of at tom robinson was that it no answer who beat you up tom robinson or your father no answer what did your father see in the window the crime of rape or the best defense to it why dont you tell the truth child didnt bob ewell beat you up when atticus turned away from mayella he looked like his stomach hurt but mayellas face was a mixture of terror and fury atticus sat down wearily and polished his glasses with his handkerchief suddenly mayella became articulate i got somethin to say she said atticus raised his head do you want to tell us what happened but she did not hear the compassion in his invitation i got somethin to say an then i aint gonna say no more that nigger yonder took advantage of me an if you fine fancy gentlemen dont wanta do nothin about it then youre all yellow stinkin cowards stinkin cowards the lot of you your fancy airs dont come to nothinyour maamin and miss mayellerin dont come to nothin mr finch then she burst into real tears her shoulders shook with angry sobs she was as good as her word she answered no more questions even when mr gilmer tried to get her back on the track i guess if she hadnt been so poor and ignorant judge taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom somehow atticus had hit her hard in a way that was not clear to me but it gave him no pleasure to do so he sat with his head down and i never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by atticuss table when mr gilmer told judge taylor that the state rested judge taylor said its time we all did well take ten minutes atticus and mr gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered then they left the courtroom by a door behind the witness stand which was a signal for us all to stretch i discovered that i had been sitting on the edge of the long bench and i was somewhat numb jem got up and yawned dill did likewise and reverend sykes wiped his face on his hat the temperature was an easy ninety he said mr braxton underwood who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the press soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain allowed his bitter eyes to rove over the colored balcony and they met mine he gave a snort and looked away jem i said mr underwoods seen us thats okay he wont tell atticus hell just put it on the social side of the tribune jem turned back to dill explaining i suppose the finer points of the trial to him but i wondered what they were there had been no lengthy debates between atticus and mr gilmer on any points mr gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are with few objections but atticus had once told us that in judge taylors court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench he distilled this for me to mean that judge taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep but he was seldom reversed and that was the proof of the pudding atticus said he was a good judge presently judge taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair he took a cigar from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully i punched dill having passed the judges inspection the cigar suffered a vicious bite we come down sometimes to watch him i explained its gonna take him the rest of the afternoon now you watch unaware of public scrutiny from above judge taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying fhluck he hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh bet he was hell with a spitball murmured dill as a rule a recess meant a general exodus but today people werent moving even the idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had remained standing along the walls i guess mr heck tate had reserved the county toilet for court officials atticus and mr gilmer returned and judge taylor looked at his watch its gettin on to four he said which was intriguing as the courthouse clock must have struck the hour at least twice i had not heard it or felt its vibrations shall we try to wind up this afternoon asked judge taylor how bout it atticus i think we can said atticus how many witnesses you got one well call him thomas robinson reached around ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it he guided his arm to the bible and his rubberlike left hand sought contact with the black binding as he raised his right hand the useless one slipped off the bible and hit the clerks table he was trying again when judge taylor growled thatll do tom tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair atticus very quickly induced him to tell us tom was twentyfive years of age he was married with three children he had been in trouble with the law before he once received thirty days for disorderly conduct it must have been disorderly said atticus what did it consist of got in a fight with another man he tried to cut me did he succeed yes suh a little not enough to hurt you see i tom moved his left shoulder yes said atticus you were both convicted yes suh i had to serve cause i couldnt pay the fine other fellow paid hisn dill leaned across me and asked jem what atticus was doing jem said atticus was showing the jury that tom had nothing to hide were you acquainted with mayella violet ewell asked atticus yes suh i had to pass her place goin to and from the field every day whose field i picks for mr link deas were you picking cotton in november no suh i works in his yard fall an wintertime i works pretty steady for him all year round hes got a lot of pecan treesn things you say you had to pass the ewell place to get to and from work is there any other way to go no suh nones i know of tom did she ever speak to you why yes suh id tip mhat when id go by and one day she asked me to come inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her when did she ask you to chop up thethe chiffarobe mr finch it was way last spring i remember it because it was choppin time and i had my hoe with me i said i didnt have nothin but this hoe but she said she had a hatchet she give me the hatchet and i broke up the chiffarobe she said i reckon ill hafta give you a nickel wont i an i said no maam there aint no charge then i went home mr finch that was way last spring way over a year ago did you ever go on the place again yes suh when well i went lots of times judge taylor instinctively reached for his gavel but let his hand fall the murmur below us died without his help under what circumstances please suh why did you go inside the fence lots of times tom robinsons forehead relaxed shed call me in suh seemed like every time i passed by yonder shed have some little somethin for me to dochoppin kindlin totin water for her she watered them red flowers every day were you paid for your services no suh not after she offered me a nickel the first time i was glad to do it mr ewell didnt seem to help her none and neither did the chillun and i knowed she didnt have no nickels to spare where were the other children they was always around all over the place theyd watch me work some of em some of emd set in the window would miss mayella talk to you yes sir she talked to me as tom robinson gave his testimony it came to me that mayella ewell must have been the loneliest person in the world she was even lonelier than boo radley who had not been out of the house in twenty five years when atticus asked had she any friends she seemed not to know what he meant then she thought he was making fun of her she was as sad i thought as what jem called a mixed child white people wouldnt have anything to do with her because she lived among pigs negroes wouldnt have anything to do with her because she was white she couldnt live like mr dolphus raymond who preferred the company of negroes because she didnt own a riverbank and she wasnt from a fine old family nobody said thats just their way about the ewells maycomb gave them christmas baskets welfare money and the back of its hand tom robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her but she said he took advantage of her and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were dirt beneath her feet did you ever atticus interrupted my meditations at any time go on the ewell propertydid you ever set foot on the ewell property without an express invitation from one of them no suh mr finch i never did i wouldnt do that suh atticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness was lying or telling the truth was to listen rather than watch i applied his testtom denied it three times in one breath but quietly with no hint of whining in his voice and i found myself believing him in spite of his protesting too much he seemed to be a respectable negro and a respectable negro would never go up into somebodys yard of his own volition tom what happened to you on the evening of november twentyfirst of last year below us the spectators drew a collective breath and leaned forward behind us the negroes did the same tom was a blackvelvet negro not shiny but soft black velvet the whites of his eyes shone in his face and when he spoke we saw flashes of his teeth if he had been whole he would have been a fine specimen of a man mr finch he said i was goin home as usual that evenin an when i passed the ewell place miss mayella were on the porch like she said she were it seemed real quiet like an i didnt quite know why i was studyin why just passin by when she says for me to come there and help her a minute well i went inside the fence an looked around for some kindlin to work on but i didnt see none and she says naw i got somethin for you to do in the house th old doors off its hinges an falls comin on pretty fast i said you got a screwdriver miss mayella she said she sho had well i went up the steps an she motioned me to come inside and i went in the front room an looked at the door i said miss mayella this door look all right i pulled it backn forth and those hinges was all right then she shet the door in my face mr finch i was wonderin why it was so quiet like an it come to me that there werent a chile on the place not a one of em and i said miss mayella where the chillun toms black velvet skin had begun to shine and he ran his hand over his face i say where the chillun he continued an she saysshe was laughin sort ofshe says they all gone to town to get ice creams she says took me a slap year to save sebm nickels but i done it they all gone to town toms discomfort was not from the humidity what did you say then tom asked atticus i said somethin like why miss mayella thats right smart oyou to treat em an she said you think so i dont think she understood what i was thinkini meant it was smart of her to save like that an nice of her to treat em i understand you tom go on said atticus well i said i best be goin i couldnt do nothin for her an she says oh yes i could an i ask her what and she says to just step on that chair yonder an git that box down from on top of the chiffarobe not the same chiffarobe you busted up asked atticus the witness smiled naw suh another one most as tall as the room so i done what she told me an i was just reachin when the next thing i knows sheshed grabbed me round the legs grabbed me round th legs mr finch she scared me so bad i hopped down an turned the chair overthat was the only thing only furniture sturbed in that room mr finch when i left it i swear fore god what happened after you turned the chair over tom robinson had come to a dead stop he glanced at atticus then at the jury then at mr underwood sitting across the room tom youre sworn to tell the whole truth will you tell it tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth what happened after that answer the question said judge taylor onethird of his cigar had vanished mr finch i got down offa that chair an turned around an she sorta jumped on me jumped on you violently no suh sheshe hugged me she hugged me round the waist this time judge taylors gavel came down with a bang and as it did the overhead lights went on in the courtroom darkness had not come but the afternoon sun had left the windows judge taylor quickly restored order then what did she do the witness swallowed hard she reached up an kissed me side of th face she says she never kissed a grown man before an she might as well kiss a nigger she says what her papa do to her dont count she says kiss me back nigger i say miss mayella lemme outa here an tried to run but she got her back to the door an ida had to push her i didnt wanta harm her mr finch an i say lemme pass but just when i say it mr ewell yonder hollered through th window what did he say tom robinson swallowed again and his eyes widened somethin not fittin to saynot fittin for these folksn chillun to hear what did he say tom you must tell the jury what he said tom robinson shut his eyes tight he says you goddamn whore ill kill ya then what happened mr finch i was runnin so fast i didnt know what happened tom did you rape mayella ewell i did not suh did you harm her in any way i did not suh did you resist her advances mr finch i tried i tried to thout bein ugly to her i didnt wanta be ugly i didnt wanta push her or nothin it occurred to me that in their own way tom robinsons manners were as good as atticuss until my father explained it to me later i did not understand the subtlety of toms predicament he would not have dared strike a white woman under any circumstances and expect to live long so he took the first opportunity to runa sure sign of guilt tom go back once more to mr ewell said atticus did he say anything to you not anything suh he mighta said somethin but i werent there thatll do atticus cut in sharply what you did hear who was he talking to mr finch he were talkin and lookin at miss mayella then you ran i sho did suh why did you run i was scared suh why were you scared mr finch if you was a nigger like me youd be scared too atticus sat down mr gilmer was making his way to the witness stand but before he got there mr link deas rose from the audience and announced i just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now that boys worked for me eight years an i aint had a speck otrouble outa him not a speck shut your mouth sir judge taylor was wide awake and roaring he was also pink in the face his speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar link deas he yelled if you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath and at the proper time but until then you get out of this room you hear me get out of this room sir you hear me ill be damned if ill listen to this case again judge taylor looked daggers at atticus as if daring him to speak but atticus had ducked his head and was laughing into his lap i remembered something he had said about judge taylors ex cathedra remarks sometimes exceeding his duty but that few lawyers ever did anything about them i looked at jem but jem shook his head it aint like one of the jurymen got up and started talking he said i think itd be different then mr link was just disturbin the peace or something judge taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written down after mr finch if you were a nigger like me youd be scared too and told the jury to disregard the interruption he looked suspiciously down the middle aisle and waited i suppose for mr link deas to effect total departure then he said go ahead mr gilmer you were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct robinson asked mr gilmer yes suh whatd the nigger look like when you got through with him he beat me mr gilmer yes but you were convicted werent you atticus raised his head it was a misdemeanor and its in the record judge i thought he sounded tired witnessll answer though said judge taylor just as wearily yes suh i got thirty days i knew that mr gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take advantage of mayella ewell that was the only reason he cared reasons like that helped robinson youre pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one hand arent you yes suh i reckon so strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor i never done that suh but you are strong enough to i reckon so suh had your eye on her a long time hadnt you boy no suh i never looked at her then you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her werent you boy i was just tryin to help her out suh that was mighty generous of you you had chores at home after your regular work didnt you yes suh why didnt you do them instead of miss ewells i done em both suh you must have been pretty busy why why what suh why were you so anxious to do that womans chores tom robinson hesitated searching for an answer looked like she didnt have nobody to help her like i says with mr ewell and seven children on the place boy well i says it looked like they never help her none you did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness boy tried to help her i says mr gilmer smiled grimly at the jury youre a mighty good fellow it seemsdid all this for not one penny yes suh i felt right sorry for her she seemed to try moren the rest of em you felt sorry for her you felt sorry for her mr gilmer seemed ready to rise to the ceiling the witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair but the damage was done below us nobody liked tom robinsons answer mr gilmer paused a long time to let it sink in now you went by the house as usual last november twentyfirst he said and she asked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe no suh do you deny that you went by the house no suhshe said she had somethin for me to do inside the house she says she asked you to bust up a chiffarobe is that right no suh it aint then you say shes lying boy atticus was on his feet but tom robinson didnt need him i dont say shes lyin mr gilmer i say shes mistaken in her mind to the next ten questions as mr gilmer reviewed mayellas version of events the witnesss steady answer was that she was mistaken in her mind didnt mr ewell run you off the place boy no suh i dont think he did dont think what do you mean i mean i didnt stay long enough for him to run me off youre very candid about this why did you run so fast i says i was scared suh if you had a clear conscience why were you scared like i says before it werent safe for any nigger to be in afix like that but you werent in a fixyou testified that you were resisting miss ewell were you so scared that shed hurt you you ran a big buck like you no suh is scared id be in court just like i am now scared of arrest scared youd have to face up to what you did no suh scared id hafta face up to what i didnt do are you being impudent to me boy no suh i didnt go to be this was as much as i heard of mr gilmers crossexamination because jem made me take dill out for some reason dill had started crying and couldnt stop quietly at first then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony jem said if i didnt go with him hed make me and reverend sykes said id better go so i went dill had seemed to be all right that day nothing wrong with him but i guessed he hadnt fully recovered from running away aint you feeling good i asked when we reached the bottom of the stairs dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps mr link deas was a lonely figure on the top step anything happenin scout he asked as we went by no sir i answered over my shoulder dill here hes sick come on out under the trees i said heat got you i expect we chose the fattest live oak and we sat under it it was just him i couldnt stand dill said who tom that old mr gilmer doin him thataway talking so hateful to him dill thats his job why if we didnt have prosecutorswell we couldnt have defense attorneys i reckon dill exhaled patiently i know all that scout it was the way he said it made me sick plain sick hes supposed to act that way dill he was cross he didnt act that way when dill those were his own witnesses well mr finch didnt act that way to mayella and old man ewell when he crossexamined them the way that man called him boy all the time an sneered at him an looked around at the jury every time he answered well dill after all hes just a negro i dont care one speck it aint right somehow it aint right to do em that way hasnt anybody got any business talkin like thatit just makes me sick thats just mr gilmers way dill he does em all that way youve never seen him get goodn down on one yet why whenwell today mr gilmer seemed to me like he wasnt half trying they do em all that way most lawyers i mean mr finch doesnt hes not an example dill hes i was trying to grope in my memory for a sharp phrase of miss maudie atkinsons i had it hes the same in the courtroom as he is on the public streets thats not what i mean said dill i know what you mean boy said a voice behind us we thought it came from the treetrunk but it belonged to mr dolphus raymond he peered around the trunk at us you arent thinhided it just makes you sick doesnt it come on round here son i got something thatll settle your stomach as mr dolphus raymond was an evil man i accepted his invitation reluctantly but i followed dill somehow i didnt think atticus would like it if we became friendly with mr raymond and i knew aunt alexandra wouldnt here he said offering dill his paper sack with straws in it take a good sip itll quieten you dill sucked on the straws smiled and pulled at length hee hee said mr raymond evidently taking delight in corrupting a child dill you watch out now i warned dill released the straws and grinned scout its nothing but cocacola mr raymond sat up against the treetrunk he had been lying on the grass you little folks wont tell on me now will you itd ruin my reputation if you did you mean all you drink in that sacks cocacola just plain cocacola yes maam mr raymond nodded i liked his smell it was of leather horses cottonseed he wore the only english riding boots i had ever seen thats all i drink most of the time then you just pretend youre half i beg your pardon sir i caught myself i didnt mean to be mr raymond chuckled not at all offended and i tried to frame a discreet question why do you do like you do whoh yes you mean why do i pretend well its very simple he said some folks dontlike the way i live now i could say the hell with em i dont care if they dont like it i do say i dont care if they dont like it right enoughbut i dont say the hell with em see dill and i said no sir i try to give em a reason you see it helps folks if they can latch onto a reason when i come to town which is seldom if i weave a little and drink out of this sack folks can say dolphus raymonds in the clutches of whiskeythats why he wont change his ways he cant help himself thats why he lives the way he does that aint honest mr raymond making yourself out baddern you are already it aint honest but its mighty helpful to folks secretly miss finch im not much of a drinker but you see they could never never understand that i live like i do because thats the way i want to live i had a feeling that i shouldnt be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed children and didnt care who knew it but he was fascinating i had never encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself but why had he entrusted us with his deepest secret i asked him why because youre children and you can understand it he said and because i heard that one he jerked his head at dill things havent caught up with that ones instinct yet let him get a little older and he wont get sick and cry maybe thingsll strike him as beingnot quite right say but he wont cry not when he gets a few years on him cry about what mr raymond dills maleness was beginning to assert itself cry about the simple hell people give other peoplewithout even thinking cry about the hell white people give colored folks without even stopping to think that theyre people too atticus says cheatin a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin a white man i muttered says its the worst thing you can do mr raymond said i dont reckon itsmiss jean louise you dont know your pas not a runofthemill man itll take a few years for that to sink inyou havent seen enough of the world yet you havent even seen this town but all you gotta do is step back inside the courthouse which reminded me that we were missing nearly all of mr gilmers crossexamination i looked at the sun and it was dropping fast behind the storetops on the west side of the square between two fires i could not decide which i wanted to jump into mr raymond or the th judicial circuit court cmon dill i said you all right now yeah glad tve metcha mr raymond and thanks for the drink it was mighty settlin we raced back to the courthouse up the steps up two flights of stairs and edged our way along the balcony rail reverend sykes had saved our seats the courtroom was still and again i wondered where the babies were judge taylors cigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth mr gilmer was writing on one of the yellow pads on his table trying to outdo the court reporter whose hand was jerking rapidly shoot i muttered we missed it atticus was halfway through his speech to the jury he had evidently pulled some papers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair because they were on his table tom robinson was toying with them absence of any corroborative evidence this man was indicted on a capital charge and is now on trial for his life i punched jem how longs he been at it hes just gone over the evidence jem whispered and were gonna win scout i dont see how we cant hes been at it bout five minutes he made it as plain and easy aswell as ida explained it to you you couldve understood it even did mr gilmer shh nothing new just the usual hush now we looked down again atticus was speaking easily with the kind of detachment he used when he dictated a letter he walked slowly up and down in front of the jury and the jury seemed to be attentive their heads were up and they followed atticuss route with what seemed to be appreciation i guess it was because atticus wasnt a thunderer atticus paused then he did something he didnt ordinarily do he unhitched his watch and chain and placed them on the table saying with the courts permission judge taylor nodded and then atticus did something i never saw him do before or since in public or in private he unbuttoned his vest unbuttoned his collar loosened his tie and took off his coat he never loosened a scrap of his clothing until he undressed at bedtime and to jem and me this was the equivalent of him standing before us stark naked we exchanged horrified glances atticus put his hands in his pockets and as he returned to the jury i saw his gold collar button and the tips of his pen and pencil winking in the light gentlemen he said jem and i again looked at each other atticus might have said scout his voice had lost its aridity its detachment and he was talking to the jury as if they were folks on the post office corner gentlemen he was saying i shall be brief but i would like to use my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one it requires no minute sifting of complicated facts but it does require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant to begin with this case should never have come to trial this case is as simple as black and white the state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime tom robinson is charged with ever took place it has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on crossexamination but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant the defendant is not guilty but somebody in this courtroom is i have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a mans life at stake which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt i say guilt gentlemen because it was guilt that motivated her she has committed no crime she has merely broken a rigid and timehonored code of our society a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with she is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance but i cannot pity her she is white she knew full well the enormity of her offense but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking she persisted in breaking it she persisted and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another she did something every child has doneshe tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her but in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband she struck out at her victimof necessity she must put him away from herhe must be removed from her presence from this world she must destroy the evidence of her offense what was the evidence of her offense tom robinson a human being she must put tom robinson away from her tom robinson was her daily reminder of what she did what did she do she tempted a negro she was white and she tempted a negro she did something that in our society is unspeakable she kissed a black man not an old uncle but a strong young negro man no code mattered to her before she broke it but it came crashing down on her afterwards her father saw it and the defendant has testified as to his remarks what did her father do we dont know but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that mayella ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left we do know in part what mr ewell did he did what any godfearing persevering respectable white man would do under the circumstanceshe swore out a warrant no doubt signing it with his left hand and tom robinson now sits before you having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesseshis right hand and so a quiet respectable humble negro who had the unmitigated temerity to feel sorry for a white woman has had to put his word against two white peoples i need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the standyou saw them for yourselves the witnesses for the state with the exception of the sheriff of maycomb county have presented themselves to you gentlemen to this court in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumptionthe evil assumptionthat all negroes lie that all negroes are basically immoral beings that all negro men are not to be trusted around our women an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber which gentlemen we know is in itself a lie as black as tom robinsons skin a lie i do not have to point out to you you know the truth and the truth is this some negroes lie some negroes are immoral some negro men are not to be trusted around womenblack or white but this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men there is not a person in this courtroom who has never told a lie who has never done an immoral thing and there is no man living who has never looked upon a woman without desire atticus paused and took out his handkerchief then he took off his glasses and wiped them and we saw another first we had never seen him sweathe was one of those men whose faces never perspired but now it was shining tan one more thing gentlemen before i quit thomas jefferson once said that all men are created equal a phrase that the yankees and the distaff side of the executive branch in washington are fond of hurling at us there is a tendency in this year of grace for certain people to use this phrase out of context to satisfy all conditions the most ridiculous example i can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious because all men are created equal educators will gravely tell you the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority we know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believesome people are smarter than others some people have more opportunity because theyre born with it some men make more money than others some ladies make better cakes than otherssome people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men but there is one way in this country in which all men are created equalthere is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a rockefeller the stupid man the equal of an einstein and the ignorant man the equal of any college president that institution gentlemen is a court it can be the supreme court of the united states or the humblest jp court in the land or this honorable court which you serve our courts have their faults as does any human institution but in this country our courts are the great levelers and in our courts all men are created equal im no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury systemthat is no ideal to me it is a living working reality gentlemen a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury a court is only as sound as its jury and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up i am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard come to a decision and restore this defendant to his family in the name of god do your duty atticuss voice had dropped and as he turned away from the jury he said something i did not catch he said it more to himself than to the court i punched jem whatd he say in the name of god believe him i think thats what he said dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at jem looka yonder we followed his finger with sinking hearts calpurnia was making her way up the middle aisle walking straight toward atticus she stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get judge taylors attention she was in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand judge taylor saw her and said its calpurnia isnt it yes sir she said could i just pass this note to mr finch please sir it hasnt got anything to do withwith the trial judge taylor nodded and atticus took the envelope from calpurnia he opened it read its contents and said judge ithis note is from my sister she says my children are missing havent turned up since noon i could you i know where they are atticus mr underwood spoke up theyre right up yonder in the colored balconybeen there since precisely oneeighteen pm our father turned around and looked up jem come down from there he called then he said something to the judge we didnt hear we climbed across reverend sykes and made our way to the staircase atticus and calpurnia met us downstairs calpurnia looked peeved but atticus looked exhausted jem was jumping in excitement weve won havent we ive no idea said atticus shortly youve been here all afternoon go home with calpurnia and get your supperand stay home aw atticus let us come back pleaded jem please let us hear the verdict please sir the jury might be out and back in a minute we dont know but we could tell atticus was relenting well youve heard it all so you might as well hear the rest tell you what you all can come back when youve eaten your suppereat slowly now you wont miss anything importantand if the jurys still out you can wait with us but i expect itll be over before you get back you think theyll acquit him that fast asked jem atticus opened his mouth to answer but shut it and left us i prayed that reverend sykes would save our seats for us but stopped praying when i remembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was outtonight theyd overrun the drugstore the ok cafe and the hotel that is unless they had brought their suppers too calpurnia marched us home skin every one of you alive the very idea you children listenin to all that mister jem dont you know bettern to take your little sister to that trial miss alexandrall absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she finds out aint fittin for children to hear the streetlights were on and we glimpsed calpurnias indignant profile as we passed beneath them mister jem i thought you was gettin some kinda head on your shouldersthe very idea shes your little sister the very idea sir you oughta be perfectly ashamed of yourselfaint you got any sense at all i was exhilarated so many things had happened so fast i felt it would take years to sort them out and now here was calpurnia giving her precious jem down the countrywhat new marvels would the evening bring jem was chuckling dont you want to hear about it cal hush your mouth sir when you oughta be hangin your head in shame you go along laughin calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved jem to little remorse and she sailed up the front steps with her classic if mr finch dont wear you out i willget in that house sir jem went in grinning and calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having dill in to supper you all call miss rachel right now and tell her where you are she told him shes run distracted lookin for youyou watch out she dont ship you back to meridian first thing in the mornin aunt alexandra met us and nearly fainted when calpurnia told her where we were i guess it hurt her when we told her atticus said we could go back because she didnt say a word during supper she just rearranged food on her plate looking at it sadly while calpurnia served jem dill and me with a vengeance calpurnia poured milk dished out potato salad and ham muttering shamed of yourselves in varying degrees of intensity now you all eat slow was her final command reverend sykes had saved our places we were surprised to find that we had been gone nearly an hour and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly as we had left it with minor changes the jury box was empty the defendant was gone judge taylor had been gone but he reappeared as we were seating ourselves nobodys moved hardly said jem they moved around some when the jury went out said reverend sykes the menfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers and they fed their babies how long have they been out asked jem bout thirty minutes mr finch and mr gilmer did some more talkin and judge taylor charged the jury how was he asked jem what say oh he did right well i aint complainin one bithe was mighty fairminded he sorta said if you believe this then youll have to return one verdict but if you believe this youll have to return another one i thought he was leanin a little to our side reverend sykes scratched his head jem smiled hes not supposed to lean reverend but dont fret weve won it he said wisely dont see how any jury could convict on what we heard now dont you be so confident mr jem i aint ever seen any jury decide in favor of a colored man over a white man but jem took exception to reverend sykes and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with jems ideas on the law regarding rape it wasnt rape if she let you but she had to be eighteenin alabama that isand mayella was nineteen apparently you had to kick and holler you had to be overpowered and stomped on preferably knocked stone cold if you were under eighteen you didnt have to go through all this mr jem reverend sykes demurred this aint a polite thing for little ladies to hear aw she doesnt know what were talkin about said jem scout this is too old for you aint it it most certainly is not i know every word youre saying perhaps i was too convincing because jem hushed and never discussed the subject again what time is it reverend he asked gettin on toward eight i looked down and saw atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets he made a tour of the windows then walked by the railing over to the jury box he looked in it inspected judge taylor on his throne then went back to where he started i caught his eye and waved to him he acknowledged my salute with a nod and resumed his tour mr gilmer was standing at the windows talking to mr underwood bert the court reporter was chainsmoking he sat back with his feet on the table but the officers of the court the ones presentatticus mr gilmer judge taylor sound asleep and bert were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal i had never seen a packed courtroom so still sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully and a child would scurry out but the grown people sat as if they were in church in the balcony the negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience the old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck the hour eight deafening bongs that shook our bones when it bonged eleven times i was past feeling tired from fighting sleep i allowed myself a short nap against reverend sykess comfortable arm and shoulder i jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so by looking down and concentrating on the heads below there were sixteen bald ones fourteen men that could pass for redheads forty heads varying between brown and black andi remembered something jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period of psychical research he said if enough people a stadium full maybewere to concentrate on one thing such as setting a tree afire in the woods that the tree would ignite of its own accord i toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrate on setting tom robinson free but thought if they were as tired as i it wouldnt work dill was sound asleep his head on jems shoulder and jem was quiet aint it a long time i asked him sure is scout he said happily well from the way you put it itd just take five minutes jem raised his eyebrows there are things you dont understand he said and i was too weary to argue but i must have been reasonably awake or i would not have received the impression that was creeping into me it was not unlike one i had last winter and i shivered though the night was hot the feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the same as a cold february morning when the mockingbirds were still and the carpenters had stopped hammering on miss maudies new house and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the radley place a deserted waiting empty street and the courtroom was packed with people a steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning mr heck tate who had entered the courtroom and was talking to atticus might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair as he listened to what mr tate was saying he ran his hand slowly up and down his thigh i expected mr tate to say any minute take him mr finch but mr tate said this court will come to order in a voice that rang with authority and the heads below us jerked up mr tate left the room and returned with tom robinson he steered tom to his place beside atticus and stood there judge taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight looking at the empty jury box what happened after that had a dreamlike quality in a dream i saw the jury return moving like underwater swimmers and judge taylors voice came from far away and was tiny i saw something only a lawyers child could be expected to see could be expected to watch for and it was like watching atticus walk into the street raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger but watching all the time knowing that the gun was empty a jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted and when this jury came in not one of them looked at tom robinson the foreman handed a piece of paper to mr tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judge i shut my eyes judge taylor was polling the jury guilty guilty guilty guilty i peeked at jem his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail and his shoulders jerked as if each guilty was a separate stab between them judge taylor was saying something his gavel was in his fist but he wasnt using it dimly i saw atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase he snapped it shut went to the court reporter and said something nodded to mr gilmer and then went to tom robinson and whispered something to him atticus put his hand on toms shoulder as he whispered atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder then he left the courtroom but not by his usual exit he must have wanted to go home the short way because he walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit i followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door he did not look up someone was punching me but i was reluctant to take my eyes from the people below us and from the image of atticuss lonely walk down the aisle miss jean louise i looked around they were standing all around us and in the balcony on the opposite wall the negroes were getting to their feet reverend sykess voice was as distant as judge taylors miss jean louise stand up your fathers passin it was jems turn to cry his face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd it aint right he muttered all the way to the corner of the square where we found atticus waiting atticus was standing under the street light looking as though nothing had happened his vest was buttoned his collar and tie were neatly in place his watchchain glistened he was his impassive self again it aint right atticus said jem no son its not right we walked home aunt alexandra was waiting up she was in her dressing gown and i could have sworn she had on her corset underneath it im sorry brother she murmured having never heard her call atticus brother before i stole a glance at jem but he was not listening he would look up at atticus then down at the floor and i wondered if he thought atticus somehow responsible for tom robinsons conviction is he all right aunty asked indicating jem hell be so presently said atticus it was a little too strong for him our father sighed im going to bed he said if i dont wake up in the morning dont call me i didnt think it wise in the first place to let them this is their home sister said atticus weve made it this way for them they might as well learn to cope with it but they dont have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it its just as much maycomb county as missionary teas atticus aunt alexandras eyes were anxious you are the last person i thought would turn bitter over this im not bitter just tired im going to bed atticus said jem bleakly he turned in the doorway what son how could they do it how could they i dont know but they did it theyve done it before and they did it tonight and theyll do it again and when they do itseems that only children weep good night but things are always better in the morning atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour and was in the livingroom behind the mobile register when we stumbled in jems morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask its not time to worry yet atticus reassured him as we went to the diningroom were not through yet therell be an appeal you can count on that gracious alive cal whats all this he was staring at his breakfast plate calpurnia said tom robinsons daddy sent you along this chicken this morning i fixed it you tell him im proud to get itbet they dont have chicken for breakfast at the white house what are these rolls said calpurnia estelle down at the hotel sent em atticus looked up at her puzzled and she said you better step out here and see whats in the kitchen mr finch we followed him the kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the family hunks of salt pork tomatoes beans even scuppernongs atticus grinned when he found a jar of pickled pigs knuckles reckon auntyll let me eat these in the diningroom calpurnia said this was all round the back steps when i got here this morning theythey preciate what you did mr finch theythey arent oversteppin themselves are they atticuss eyes filled with tears he did not speak for a moment tell them im very grateful he said tell themtell them they must never do this again times are too hard he left the kitchen went in the diningroom and excused himself to aunt alexandra put on his hat and went to town we heard dills step in the hall so calpurnia left atticuss uneaten breakfast on the table between rabbitbites dill told us of miss rachels reaction to last night which was if a man like atticus finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall its his head ida got her told growled dill gnawing a chicken leg but she didnt look much like tellin this morning said she was up half the night wonderin where i was said sheda had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing dill youve got to stop goin off without tellin her said jem it just aggravates her dill sighed patiently i told her till i was blue in the face where i was goinshes just seein too many snakes in the closet bet that woman drinks a pint for breakfast every morningknow she drinks two glasses full seen her dont talk like that dill said aunt alexandra its not becoming to a child itscynical i aint cynical miss alexandra tellin the truths not cynical is it the way you tell it it is jems eyes flashed at her but he said to dill lets go you can take that runner with you when we went to the front porch miss stephanie crawford was busy telling it to miss maudie atkinson and mr avery they looked around at us and went on talking jem made a feral noise in his throat i wished for a weapon i hate grown folks lookin at you said dill makes you feel like youve done something miss maudie yelled for jem finch to come there jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing well go with you dill said miss stephanies nose quivered with curiosity she wanted to know who all gave us permission to go to courtshe didnt see us but it was all over town this morning that we were in the colored balcony did atticus put us up there as a sort of wasnt it right close up there with all those did scout understand all the didnt it make us mad to see our daddy beat hush stephanie miss maudies diction was deadly ive not got all the morning to pass on the porchjem finch i called to find out if you and your colleagues can eat some cake got up at five to make it so you better say yes excuse us stephanie good morning mr avery there was a big cake and two little ones on miss maudies kitchen table there should have been three little ones it was not like miss maudie to forget dill and we must have shown it but we understood when she cut from the big cake and gave the slice to jem as we ate we sensed that this was miss maudies way of saying that as far as she was concerned nothing had changed she sat quietly in a kitchen chair watching us suddenly she spoke dont fret jem things are never as bad as they seem indoors when miss maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her fingers on her knees and settled her bridgework this she did and we waited i simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us your fathers one of them oh said jem well dont you oh well me sir miss maudie replied recognizing jems fatalistic noises you are not old enough to appreciate what i said jem was staring at his halfeaten cake its like bein a caterpillar in a cocoon thats what it is he said like somethin asleep wrapped up in a warm place i always thought maycomb folks were the best folks in the world least thats what they seemed like were the safest folks in the world said miss maudie were so rarely called on to be christians but when we are weve got men like atticus to go for us jem grinned ruefully wish the rest of the county thought that youd be surprised how many of us do who jems voice rose who in this town did one thing to help tom robinson just who his colored friends for one thing and people like us people like judge taylor people like mr heck tate stop eating and start thinking jem did it ever strike you that judge taylor naming atticus to defend that boy was no accident that judge taylor might have had his reasons for naming him this was a thought courtappointed defenses were usually given to maxwell green maycombs latest addition to the bar who needed the experience maxwell green should have had tom robinsons case you think about that miss maudie was saying it was no accident i was sittin there on the porch last night waiting i waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk and as i waited i thought atticus finch wont win he cant win but hes the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that and i thought to myself well were making a stepits just a babystep but its a step ts all right to talk like thatcant any christian judges an lawyers make up for heathen juries jem muttered soons i get grown thats something youll have to take up with your father miss maudie said we went down miss maudies cool new steps into the sunshine and found mr avery and miss stephanie crawford still at it they had moved down the sidewalk and were standing in front of miss stephanies house miss rachel was walking toward them i think ill be a clown when i get grown said dill jem and i stopped in our tracks yes sir a clown he said there aint one thing in this world i can do about folks except laugh so im gonna join the circus and laugh my head off you got it backwards dill said jem clowns are sad its folks that laugh at them well im gonna be a new kind of clown im gonna stand in the middle of the ring and laugh at the folks just looka yonder he pointed every one of em oughta be ridin broomsticks aunt rachel already does miss stephanie and miss rachel were waving wildly at us in a way that did not give the lie to dills observation oh gosh breathed jem i reckon itd be ugly not to see em something was wrong mr avery was red in the face from a sneezing spell and nearly blew us off the sidewalk when we came up miss stephanie was trembling with excitement and miss rachel caught dills shoulder you get on in the back yard and stay there she said theres danger acomin s matter i asked aint you heard yet its all over town at that moment aunt alexandra came to the door and called us but she was too late it was miss stephanies pleasure to tell us this morning mr bob ewell stopped atticus on the post office corner spat in his face and told him hed get him if it took the rest of his life i wish bob ewell wouldnt chew tobacco was all atticus said about it according to miss stephanie crawford however atticus was leaving the post office when mr ewell approached him cursed him spat on him and threatened to kill him miss stephanie who by the time she had told it twice was there and had seen it allpassing by from the jitney jungle she wasmiss stephanie said atticus didnt bat an eye just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let mr ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to repeat mr ewell was a veteran of an obscure war that plus atticuss peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire too proud to fight you niggerlovin bastard miss stephanie said atticus said no too old put his hands in his pockets and strolled on miss stephanie said you had to hand it to atticus finch he could be right dry sometimes jem and i didnt think it entertaining after all though i said he was the deadest shot in the county one time he could you know he wouldnt carry a gun scout he aint even got one said jem you know he didnt even have one down at the jail that night he told me havin a gun arounds an invitation to somebody to shoot you this is different i said we can ask him to borrow one we did and he said nonsense dill was of the opinion that an appeal to atticuss better nature might work after all we would starve if mr ewell killed him besides be raised exclusively by aunt alexandra and we all knew the first thing shed do before atticus was under the ground good would be to fire calpurnia jem said it might work if i cried and flung a fit being young and a girl that didnt work either but when he noticed us dragging around the neighborhood not eating taking little interest in our normal pursuits atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were he tempted jem with a new football magazine one night when he saw jem flip the pages and toss it aside he said whats bothering you son jem came to the point mr ewell what has happened nothings happened were scared for you and we think you oughta do something about him atticus smiled wryly do what put him under a peace bond when a man says hes gonna get you looks like he means it he meant it when he said it said atticus jem see if you can stand in bob ewells shoes a minute i destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial if he had any to begin with the man had to have some kind of comeback his kind always does so if spitting in my face and threatening me saved mayella ewell one extra beating thats something ill gladly take he had to take it out on somebody and id rather it be me than that houseful of children out there you understand jem nodded aunt alexandra entered the room as atticus was saying we dont have anything to fear from bob ewell he got it all out of his system that morning i wouldnt be so sure of that atticus she said his kindd do anything to pay off a grudge you know how those people are what on earth could ewell do to me sister something furtive aunt alexandra said you may count on that nobody has much chance to be furtive in maycomb atticus answered after that we were not afraid summer was melting away and we made the most of it atticus assured us that nothing would happen to tom robinson until the higher court reviewed his case and that tom had a good chance of going free or at least of having a new trial he was at enfield prison farm seventy miles away in chester county i asked atticus if toms wife and children were allowed to visit him but atticus said no if he loses his appeal i asked one evening whatll happen to him hell go to the chair said atticus unless the governor commutes his sentence not time to worry yet scout weve got a good chance jem was sprawled on the sofa reading popular mechanics he looked up it aint right he didnt kill anybody even if he was guilty he didnt take anybodys life you know rapes a capital offense in alabama said atticus yessir but the jury didnt have to give him deathif they wanted to they couldve gave him twenty years given said atticus tom robinsons a colored man jem no jury in this part of the worlds going to say we think youre guilty but not very on a charge like that it was either a straight acquittal or nothing jem was shaking his head i know its not right but i cant figure out whats wrongmaybe rape shouldnt be a capital offense atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair he said he didnt have any quarrel with the rape statute none what ever but he did have deep misgivings when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence he glanced at me saw i was listening and made it easier i mean before a man is sentenced to death for murder say there should be one or two eyewitnesses some one should be able to say yes i was there and saw him pull the trigger but lots of folks have been hunghangedon circumstantial evidence said jem i know and lots of em probably deserved it toobut in the absence of eyewitnesses theres always a doubt some times only the shadow of a doubt the law says reasonable doubt but i think a defendants entitled to the shadow of a doubt theres always the possibility no matter how improbable that hes innocent then it all goes back to the jury then we oughta do away with juries jem was adamant atticus tried hard not to smile but couldnt help it youre rather hard on us son i think maybe there might be a better way change the law change it so that only judges have the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases then go up to montgomery and change the law youd be surprised how hard thatd be i wont live to see the law changed and if you live to see it youll be an old man this was not good enough for jem no sir they oughta do away with juries he wasnt guilty in the first place and they said he was if you had been on that jury son and eleven other boys like you tom would be a free man said atticus so far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoning process those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life toms jury but you saw something come between them and reason you saw the same thing that night in front of the jail when that crew went away they didnt go as reasonable men they went because we were there theres something in our world that makes men lose their headsthey couldnt be fair if they tried in our courts when its a white mans word against a black mans the white man always wins theyre ugly but those are the facts of life doesnt make it right said jem stolidly he beat his fist softly on his knee you just cant convict a man on evidence like thatyou cant you couldnt but they could and did the older you grow the more of it youll see the one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom be he any color of the rainbow but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box as you grow older youll see white men cheat black men every day of your life but let me tell you something and dont you forget itwhenever a white man does that to a black man no matter who he is how rich he is or how fine a family he comes from that white man is trash atticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears i looked up and his face was vehement theres nothing more sickening to me than a lowgrade white man wholl take advantage of a negros ignorance dont fool yourselvesits all adding up and one of these days were going to pay the bill for it i hope its not in you childrens time jem was scratching his head suddenly his eyes widened atticus he said why dont people like us and miss maudie ever sit on juries you never see anybody from maycomb on a jurythey all come from out in the woods atticus leaned back in his rockingchair for some reason he looked pleased with jem i was wondering when thatd occur to you he said there are lots of reasons for one thing miss maudie cant serve on a jury because shes a woman you mean women in alabama cant i was indignant i do i guess its to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like toms besides atticus grinned i doubt if wed ever get a complete case triedthe ladiesd be interrupting to ask questions jem and i laughed miss maudie on a jury would be impressive i thought of old mrs dubose in her wheelchairstop that rapping john taylor i want to ask this man something perhaps our forefathers were wise atticus was saying with people like usthats our share of the bill we generally get the juries we deserve our stout maycomb citizens arent interested in the first place in the second place theyre afraid then theyre afraid why asked jem well what ifsay mr link deas had to decide the amount of damages to award say miss maudie when miss rachel ran over her with a car link wouldnt like the thought of losing either ladys business at his store would he so he tells judge taylor that he cant serve on the jury because he doesnt have anybody to keep store for him while hes gone so judge taylor excuses him sometimes he excuses him wrathfully whatd make him think either one of emd stop trading with him i asked jem said miss rachel would miss maudie wouldnt but a jurys votes secret atticus our father chuckled youve many more miles to go son a jurys votes supposed to be secret serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and declare himself about something men dont like to do that sometimes its unpleasant toms jury sho made up its mind in a hurry jem muttered atticuss fingers went to his watchpocket no it didnt he said more to himself than to us that was the one thing that made me think well this may be the shadow of a beginning that jury took a few hours an inevitable verdict maybe but usually it takes em just a few minutes this time he broke off and looked at us you might like to know that there was one fellow who took considerable wearing down in the beginning he was rarin for an outright acquittal who jem was astonished atticuss eyes twinkled its not for me to say but ill tell you this much he was one of your old sarum friends one of the cunninghams jem yelped one ofi didnt recognize any of em youre jokin he looked at atticus from the corners of his eyes one of their connections on a hunch i didnt strike him just on a hunch couldve but i didnt golly moses jem said reverently one minute theyre tryin to kill him and the next theyre tryin to turn him loose ill never understand those folks as long as i live atticus said you just had to know em he said the cunninghams hadnt taken anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the new world he said the other thing about them was once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail atticus said he had a feeling nothing more than a suspicion that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the finches then too he said it took a thunderbolt plus another cunningham to make one of them change his mind if wed had two of that crowd wedve had a hung jury jem said slowly you mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before how could you take such a risk atticus how could you when you analyze it there was little risk theres no difference between one man whos going to convict and another man whos going to convict is there theres a faint difference between a man whos going to convict and a man whos a little disturbed in his mind isnt there he was the only uncertainty on the whole list what kin was that man to mr walter cunningham i asked atticus rose stretched and yawned it was not even our bedtime but we knew he wanted a chance to read his newspaper he picked it up folded it and tapped my head lets see now he droned to himself ive got it double first cousin how can that be two sisters married two brothers thats all ill tell youyou figure it out i tortured myself and decided that if i married jem and dill had a sister whom he married our children would be double first cousins gee minetti jem i said when atticus had gone theyre funny folks d you hear that aunty aunt alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us but she was listening she sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it her rug spread across her lap why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me i heard it she said i remembered the distant disastrous occasion when i rushed to young walter cunninghams defense now i was glad id done it soons school starts im gonna ask walter home to dinner i planned having forgotten my private resolve to beat him up the next time i saw him he can stay over sometimes after school too atticus could drive him back to old sarum maybe he could spend the night with us sometime okay jem well see about that aunt alexandra said a declaration that with her was always a threat never a promise surprised i turned to her why not aunty theyre good folks she looked at me over her sewing glasses jean louise there is no doubt in my mind that theyre good folks but theyre not our kind of folks jem says she means theyre yappy scout whats a yap aw tacky they like fiddlin and things like that well i do too dont be silly jean louise said aunt alexandra the thing is you can scrub walter cunningham till he shines you can put him in shoes and a new suit but hell never be like jem besides theres a drinking streak in that family a mile wide finch women arent interested in that sort of people aunty said jem she aint nine yet she may as well learn it now aunt alexandra had spoken i was reminded vividly of the last time she had put her foot down i never knew why it was when i was absorbed with plans to visit calpurnias housei was curious interested i wanted to be her company to see how she lived who her friends were i might as well have wanted to see the other side of the moon this time the tactics were different but aunt alexandras aim was the same perhaps this was why she had come to live with usto help us choose our friends i would hold her off as long as i could if theyre good folks then why cant i be nice to walter i didnt say not to be nice to him you should be friendly and polite to him you should be gracious to everybody dear but you dont have to invite him home what if he was kin to us aunty the fact is that he is not kin to us but if he were my answer would be the same aunty jem spoke up atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho cant choose your family an theyre still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge em or not and it makes you look right silly when you dont thats your father all over again said aunt alexandra and i still say that jean louise will not invite walter cunningham to this house if he were her double first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he comes to see atticus on business now that is that she had said indeed not but this time she would give her reasons but i want to play with walter aunty why cant i she took off her glasses and stared at me ill tell you why she said becauseheistrash thats why you cant play with him ill not have you around him picking up his habits and learning lordknowswhat youre enough of a problem to your father as it is i dont know what i would have done but jem stopped me he caught me by the shoulders put his arm around me and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom atticus heard us and poked his head around the door s all right sir jem said gruffly s not anything atticus went away have a chew scout jem dug into his pocket and extracted a tootsie roll it took a few minutes to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser his hair stuck up behind and down in front and i wondered if it would ever look like a mansmaybe if he shaved it off and started over his hair would grow back neatly in place his eyebrows were becoming heavier and i noticed a new slimness about his body he was growing taller when he looked around he must have thought i would start crying again for he said show you something if you wont tell anybody i said what he unbuttoned his shirt grinning shyly well what well cant you see it well no well its hair where there right there he had been a comfort to me so i said it looked lovely but i didnt see anything its real nice jem under my arms too he said goin out for football next year scout dont let aunty aggravate you it seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate aunty you know shes not used to girls said jem leastways not girls like you shes trying to make you a lady cant you take up sewin or somethin hell no she doesnt like me thats all there is to it and i dont care it was her callin walter cunningham trash that got me goin jem not what she said about being a problem to atticus we got that all straight one time i asked him if i was a problem and he said not much of one at most one that he could always figure out and not to worry my head a second about botherin him naw it was walterthat boys not trash jem he aint like the ewells jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed he propped himself against a pillow and switched on the reading light you know something scout ive got it all figured out now ive thought about it a lot lately and ive got it figured out theres four kinds of folks in the world theres the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors theres the kind like the cunninghams out in the woods the kind like the ewells down at the dump and the negroes what about the chinese and the cajuns down yonder in baldwin county i mean in maycomb county the thing about it is our kind of folks dont like the cunninghams the cunninghams dont like the ewells and the ewells hate and despise the colored folks i told jem if that was so then why didnt toms jury made up of folks like the cunninghams acquit tom to spite the ewells jem waved my question away as being infantile you know he said ive seen atticus pat his foot when theres fiddlin on the radio and he loves pot liquor bettern any man i ever saw then that makes us like the cunninghams i said i cant see why aunty no lemme finishit does but were still different somehow atticus said one time the reason auntys so hipped on the family is because all weve gots background and not a dime to our names well jem i dont knowatticus told me one time that most of this old family stuffs foolishness because everybodys familys just as old as everybody elses i said did that include the colored folks and englishmen and he said yes background doesnt mean old family said jem i think its how long your familys been readin and writin scout ive studied this real hard and thats the only reason i can think of somewhere along when the finches were in egypt one of em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy jem laughed imagine aunty being proud her greatgrandaddy could read an writeladies pick funny things to be proud of well im glad he could or whoda taught atticus and them and if atticus couldnt read you and med be in a fix i dont think thats what background is jem well then how do you explain why the cunninghams are different mr walter can hardly sign his name ive seen him weve just been readin and writin longern they have no everybodys gotta learn nobodys born knowin that walters as smart as he can be he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy nothins wrong with him naw jem i think theres just one kind of folks folks jem turned around and punched his pillow when he settled back his face was cloudy he was going into one of his declines and i grew wary his brows came together his mouth became a thin line he was silent for a while thats what i thought too he said at last when i was your age if theres just one kind of folks why cant they get along with each other if theyre all alike why do they go out of their way to despise each other scout i think im beginning to understand something i think im beginning to understand why boo radleys stayed shut up in the house all this time its because he wants to stay inside calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron she carried a tray of charlotte she backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently i admired the ease and grace with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things so did aunt alexandra i guess because she had let calpurnia serve today august was on the brink of september dill would be leaving for meridian tomorrow today he was off with jem at barkers eddy jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach dill how to swim a skill jem considered necessary as walking they had spent two afternoons at the creek they said they were going in naked and i couldnt come so i divided the lonely hours between calpurnia and miss maudie today aunt alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all over the house from the kitchen i heard mrs grace merriweather giving a report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the mrunas it sounded like to me they put the women out in huts when their time came whatever that was they had no sense of family i knew thatd distress auntythey subjected children to terrible ordeals when they were thirteen they were crawling with yaws and earworms they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it immediately thereafter the ladies adjourned for refreshments i didnt know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out aunt alexandra told me to join them for refreshments it was not necessary that i attend the business part of the meeting she said itd bore me i was wearing my pink sunday dress shoes and a petticoat and reflected that if i spilled anything calpurnia would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow this had been a busy day for her i decided to stay out can i help you cal i asked wishing to be of some service calpurnia paused in the doorway you be still as a mouse in that corner she said an you can help me load up the trays when i come back the gentle hum of ladies voices grew louder as she opened the door why alexandra i never saw such charlotte just lovely i never can get my crust like this never can whodve thought of little dewberry tarts calpurnia whoda thought it anybody tell you that the preachers wifes nooo well she is and that other one not walkin yet they became quiet and i knew they had all been served calpurnia returned and put my mothers heavy silver pitcher on a tray this coffee pitchers a curiosity she murmured they dont make em these days can i carry it in if you be careful and dont drop it set it down at the end of the table by miss alexandra down there by the cupsn things shes gonna pour i tried pressing my behind against the door as calpurnia had done but the door didnt budge grinning she held it open for me careful now its heavy dont look at it and you wont spill it my journey was successful aunt alexandra smiled brilliantly stay with us jean louise she said this was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady it was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for refreshments be they baptists or presbyterians which accounted for the presence of miss rachel sober as a judge miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford rather nervous i took a seat beside miss maudie and wondered why ladies put on their hats to go across the street ladies in bunches always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere but this feeling was what aunt alexandra called being spoiled the ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints most of them were heavily powdered but unrouged the only lipstick in the room was tangee natural cutex natural sparkled on their fingernails but some of the younger ladies wore rose they smelled heavenly i sat quietly having conquered my hands by tightly gripping the arms of the chair and waited for someone to speak to me miss maudies gold bridgework twinkled youre mighty dressed up miss jean louise she said where are your britches today under my dress i hadnt meant to be funny but the ladies laughed my cheeks grew hot as i realized my mistake but miss maudie looked gravely down at me she never laughed at me unless i meant to be funny in the sudden silence that followed miss stephanie crawford called from across the room whatcha going to be when you grow up jean louise a lawyer nome i hadnt thought about it i answered grateful that miss stephanie was kind enough to change the subject hurriedly i began choosing my vocation nurse aviator well why shoot i thought you wanted to be a lawyer youve already commenced going to court the ladies laughed again that stephanies a card somebody said miss stephanie was encouraged to pursue the subject dont you want to grow up to be a lawyer miss maudies hand touched mine and i answered mildly enough nome just a lady miss stephanie eyed me suspiciously decided that i meant no impertinence and contented herself with well you wont get very far until you start wearing dresses more often miss maudies hand closed tightly on mine and i said nothing its warmth was enough mrs grace merriweather sat on my left and i felt it would be polite to talk to her mr merriweather a faithful methodist under duress apparently saw nothing personal in singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me it was the general opinion of maycomb however that mrs merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him for certainly mrs merriweather was the most devout lady in maycomb i searched for a topic of interest to her what did you all study this afternoon i asked oh child those poor mrunas she said and was off few other questions would be necessary mrs merriweathers large brown eyes always filled with tears when she considered the oppressed living in that jungle with nobody but j grimes everett she said not a white personll go near em but that saintly j grimes everett mrs merriweather played her voice like an organ every word she said received its full measure the poverty the darkness the immoralitynobody but j grimes everett knows you know when the church gave me that trip to the camp grounds j grimes everett said to me was he there maam i thought home on leave j grimes everett said to me he said mrs merriweather you have no conception no con cep tion of what we are fighting over there thats what he said to me yes maam i said to him mr everett i said the ladies of the maycomb alabama methodist episcopal church south are behind you one hundred percent thats what i said to him and you know right then and there i made a pledge in my heart i said to myself when i go home im going to give a course on the mrunas and bring j grimes everetts message to maycomb and thats just what im doing yes maam when mrs merriweather shook her head her black curls jiggled jean louise she said you are a fortunate girl you live in a christian home with christian folks in a christian town out there in j grimes everetts land theres nothing but sin and squalor yes maam sin and squalorwhat was that gertrude mrs merriweather turned on her chimes for the lady sitting beside her oh that well i always say forgive and forget forgive and forget thing that church ought to do is help her lead a christian life for those children from here on out some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher to encourage her excuse me mrs merriweather i interrupted are you all talking about mayella ewell may no child that darkys wife toms wife tom robinson maam mrs merriweather turned back to her neighbor theres one thing i truly believe gertrude she continued but some people just dont see it my way if we just let them know we forgive em that weve forgotten it then this whole thingll blow over ahmrs merriweather i interrupted once more whatll blow over again she turned to me mrs merriweather was one of those childless adults who find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children nothing jean louise she said in stately largo the cooks and field hands are just dissatisfied but theyre settling down nowthey grumbled all next day after that trial mrs merriweather faced mrs farrow gertrude i tell you theres nothing more distracting than a sulky darky their mouths go down to here just ruins your day to have one of em in the kitchen you know what i said to my sophy gertrude i said sophy i said you simply are not being a christian today jesus christ never went around grumbling and complaining and you know it did her good she took her eyes off that floor and said nome miz merriweather jesus never went around grumblin i tell you gertrude you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the lord i was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at finchs landing when i was very small and if i had been very good during the day atticus would let me pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger the last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it mrs merriweather had run out of air i judged and was replenishing her supply while mrs farrow composed herself to speak mrs farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet she had a fresh permanent wave and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets she was the second most devout lady in maycomb she had a curious habit of prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound sss grace she said its just like i was telling brother hutson the other day sss brother hutson i said looks like were fighting a losing battle a losing battle i said sss it doesnt matter to em one bit we can educate em till were blue in the face we can try till we drop to make christians out of em but theres no lady safe in her bed these nights he said to me mrs farrow i dont know what were coming to down here sss i told him that was certainly a fact mrs merriweather nodded wisely her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups and the soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties gertrude she said i tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town good but misguided folks in this town who think theyre doing right i mean now far be it from me to say who but some of em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back but all they did was stir em up thats all they did mightve looked like the right thing to do at the time im sure i dont know im not read in that field but sulky dissatisfied i tell you if my sophyd kept it up another day id have let her go its never entered that wool of hers that the only reason i keep her is because this depressions on and she needs her dollar and a quarter every week she can get it his food doesnt stick going down does it miss maudie said it two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth she had been sitting silently beside me her coffee cup balanced on one knee i had lost the thread of conversation long ago when they quit talking about tom robinsons wife and had contented myself with thinking of finchs landing and the river aunt alexandra had got it backwards the business part of the meeting was bloodcurdling the social hour was dreary maudie im sure i dont know what you mean said mrs merriweather im sure you do miss maudie said shortly she said no more when miss maudie was angry her brevity was icy something had made her deeply angry and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice mrs merriweather reddened glanced at me and looked away i could not see mrs farrow aunt alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments neatly engaging mrs merriweather and mrs gates in brisk conversation when she had them well on the road with mrs perkins aunt alexandra stepped back she gave miss maudie a look of pure gratitude and i wondered at the world of women miss maudie and aunt alexandra had never been especially close and here was aunty silently thanking her for something for what i knew not i was content to learn that aunt alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given there was no doubt about it i must soon enter this world where on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly fanned gently and drank cool water but i was more at home in my fathers world people like mr heck tate did not trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you even jem was not highly critical unless you said something stupid ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them but i liked them there was something about them no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed no matter how undelectable they were there was something about them that i instinctively liked they werent hypocrites mrs perkins born hypocrites mrs merriweather was saying at least we dont have that sin on our shoulders down here people up there set em free but you dont see em settin at the table with em at least we dont have the deceit to say to em yes youre as good as we are but stay away from us down here we just say you live your way and well live ours i think that woman that mrs roosevelts lost her mindjust plain lost her mind coming down to birmingham and tryin to sit with em if i was the mayor of birmingham id well neither of us was the mayor of birmingham but i wished i was the governor of alabama for one day id let tom robinson go so quick the missionary society wouldnt have time to catch its breath calpurnia was telling miss rachels cook the other day how bad tom was taking things and she didnt stop talking when i came into the kitchen she said there wasnt a thing atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him that the last thing he said to atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was goodbye mr finch there aint nothin you can do now so there aint no use tryin calpurnia said atticus told her that the day they took tom to prison he just gave up hope she said atticus tried to explain things to him and that he must do his best not to lose hope because atticus was doing his best to get him free miss rachels cook asked calpurnia why didnt atticus just say yes youll go free and leave it at thatseemed like thatd be a big comfort to tom calpurnia said because you aint familiar with the law first thing you learn when youre in a lawin family is that there aint any definite answers to anything mr finch couldnt say somethins so when he doesnt know for sure its so the front door slammed and i heard atticuss footsteps in the hall automatically i wondered what time it was not nearly time for him to be home and on missionary society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark he stopped in the doorway his hat was in his hand and his face was white excuse me ladies he said go right ahead with your meeting dont let me disturb you alexandra could you come to the kitchen a minute i want to borrow calpurnia for a while he didnt go through the diningroom but went down the back hallway and entered the kitchen from the rear door aunt alexandra and i met him the diningroom door opened again and miss maudie joined us calpurnia had half risen from her chair cal atticus said i want you to go with me out to helen robinsons house whats the matter aunt alexandra asked alarmed by the look on my fathers face toms dead aunt alexandra put her hands to her mouth they shot him said atticus he was running it was during their exercise period they said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over right in front of them didnt they try to stop him didnt they give him any warning aunt alexandras voice shook oh yes the guards called to him to stop they fired a few shots in the air then to kill they got him just as he went over the fence they said if hed had two good arms hed have made it he was moving that fast seventeen bullet holes in him they didnt have to shoot him that much cal i want you to come out with me and help me tell helen yes sir she murmured fumbling at her apron miss maudie went to calpurnia and untied it this is the last straw atticus aunt alexandra said depends on how you look at it he said what was one negro more or less among two hundred of em he wasnt tom to them he was an escaping prisoner atticus leaned against the refrigerator pushed up his glasses and rubbed his eyes we had such a good chance he said i told him what i thought but i couldnt in truth say that we had more than a good chance i guess tom was tired of white mens chances and preferred to take his own ready cal yessir mr finch then lets go aunt alexandra sat down in calpurnias chair and put her hands to her face she sat quite still she was so quiet i wondered if she would faint i heard miss maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps and in the diningroom the ladies chattered happily i thought aunt alexandra was crying but when she took her hands away from her face she was not she looked weary she spoke and her voice was flat i cant say i approve of everything he does maudie but hes my brother and i just want to know when this will ever end her voice rose it tears him to pieces he doesnt show it much but it tears him to pieces ive seen him whenwhat else do they want from him maudie what else what does who want alexandra miss maudie asked i mean this town theyre perfectly willing to let him do what theyre too afraid to do themselvesit might lose em a nickel theyre perfectly willing to let him wreck his health doing what theyre afraid to do theyre be quiet theyll hear you said miss maudie have you ever thought of it this way alexandra whether maycomb knows it or not were paying the highest tribute we can pay a man we trust him to do right its that simple who aunt alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelveyearold nephew the handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked white only the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody not just us the handful of people with enough humility to think when they look at a negro there but for the lords kindness am l miss maudies old crispness was returning the handful of people in this town with background thats who they are had i been attentive i would have had another scrap to add to jems definition of background but i found myself shaking and couldnt stop i had seen enfield prison farm and atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me it was the size of a football field stop that shaking commanded miss maudie and i stopped get up alexandra weve left em long enough aunt alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips she took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose she patted her hair and said do i show it not a sign said miss maudie are you together again jean louise yes maam then lets join the ladies she said grimly their voices swelled when miss maudie opened the door to the diningroom aunt alexandra was ahead of me and i saw her head go up as she went through the door oh mrs perkins she said you need some more coffee let me get it calpurnias on an errand for a few minutes grace said miss maudie let me pass you some more of those dewberry tarts dyou hear what that cousin of mine did the other day the one who likes to go fishing and so they went down the row of laughing women around the diningroom refilling coffee cups dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the temporary domestic disaster of losing calpurnia the gentle hum began again yes sir mrs perkins that j grimes everett is a martyred saint he needed to get married so they ran to the beauty parlor every saturday afternoon soon as the sun goes down he goes to bed with the chickens a crate full of sick chickens fred says thats what started it all fred says aunt alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled she looked at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them i carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to mrs merriweather with my best company manners i asked her if she would have some after all if aunty could be a lady at a time like this so could i dont do that scout set him out on the back steps jem are you crazy i said set him out on the back steps sighing i scooped up the small creature placed him on the bottom step and went back to my cot september had come but not a trace of cool weather with it and we were still sleeping on the back screen porch lightning bugs were still about the night crawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long had not gone wherever they go when autumn comes a rolypoly had found his way inside the house i reasoned that the tiny varmint had crawled up the steps and under the door i was putting my book on the floor beside my cot when i saw him the creatures are no more than an inch long and when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball i lay on my stomach reached down and poked him he rolled up then feeling safe i suppose he slowly unrolled he traveled a few inches on his hundred legs and i touched him again he rolled up feeling sleepy i decided to end things my hand was going down on him when jem spoke jem was scowling it was probably a part of the stage he was going through and i wished he would hurry up and get through it he was certainly never cruel to animals but i had never known his charity to embrace the insect world why couldnt i mash him i asked because they dont bother you jem answered in the darkness he had turned out his reading light reckon youre at the stage now where you dont kill flies and mosquitoes now i reckon i said lemme know when you change your mind tell you one thing though i aint gonna sit around and not scratch a redbug aw dry up he answered drowsily jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day not i comfortable i lay on my back and waited for sleep and while waiting i thought of dill he had left us the first of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was outhe guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summers in maycomb miss rachel took us with them in the taxi to maycomb junction and dill waved to us from the train window until he was out of sight he was not out of mind i missed him the last two days of his time with us jem had taught him to swimtaught him to swim i was wide awake remembering what dill had told me barkers eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the meridian highway about a mile from town it is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist and the short walk to the creek is easy but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk when the traffic is light is tiresome and swimmers are careful not to stay too late according to dill he and jem had just come to the highway when they saw atticus driving toward them he looked like he had not seen them so they both waved atticus finally slowed down when they caught up with him he said youd better catch a ride back i wont be going home for a while calpurnia was in the back seat jem protested then pleaded and atticus said all right you can come with us if you stay in the car on the way to tom robinsons atticus told them what had happened they turned off the highway rode slowly by the dump and past the ewell residence down the narrow lane to the negro cabins dill said a crowd of black children were playing marbles in toms front yard atticus parked the car and got out calpurnia followed him through the front gate dill heard him ask one of the children wheres your mother sam and heard sam say she down at sis stevenss mr finch want me run fetch her dill said atticus looked uncertain then he said yes and sam scampered off go on with your game boys atticus said to the children a little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at atticus dill said her hair was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails each ending in a bright bow she grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our father but she was too small to navigate the steps dill said atticus went to her took off his hat and offered her his finger she grabbed it and he eased her down the steps then he gave her to calpurnia sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up dill said helen said evenin mr finch wont you have a seat but she didnt say any more neither did atticus scout said dill she just fell down in the dirt just fell down in the dirt like a giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her just ump dills fat foot hit the ground like youd step on an ant dill said calpurnia and atticus lifted helen to her feet and half carried half walked her to the cabin they stayed inside a long time and atticus came out alone when they drove back by the dump some of the ewells hollered at them but dill didnt catch what they said maycomb was interested by the news of toms death for perhaps two days two days was enough for the information to spread through the county did you hear about no well they say he was runnin fit to beat lightnin to maycomb toms death was typical typical of a nigger to cut and run typical of a niggers mentality to have no plan no thought for the future just run blind first chance he saw funny thing atticus finch mightve got him off scot free but wait hell no you know how they are easy come easy go just shows you that robinson boy was legally married they say he kept himself clean went to church and all that but when it comes down to the line the veneers mighty thin nigger always comes out in em a few more details enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn then nothing to talk about until the maycomb tribune appeared the following thursday there was a brief obituary in the colored news but there was also an editorial mr b b underwood was at his most bitter and he couldnt have cared less who canceled advertising and subscriptions but maycomb didnt play that way mr underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to hed still get his advertising and subscriptions if he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper that was his business mr underwood didnt talk about miscarriages of justice he was writing so children could understand mr underwood simply figured it was a sin to kill cripples be they standing sitting or escaping he likened toms death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children and maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in the montgomery advertiser how could this be so i wondered as i read mr underwoods editorial senseless killingtom had been given due process of law to the day of his death he had been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true my father had fought for him all the way then mr underwoods meaning became clear atticus had used every tool available to free men to save tom robinson but in the secret courts of mens hearts atticus had no case tom was a dead man the minute mayella ewell opened her mouth and screamed the name ewell gave me a queasy feeling maycomb had lost no time in getting mr ewells views on toms demise and passing them along through that english channel of gossip miss stephanie crawford miss stephanie told aunt alexandra in jems presence oh foot hes old enough to listen that mr ewell said it made one down and about two more to go jem told me not to be afraid mr ewell was more hot gas than anything jem also told me that if i breathed a word to atticus if in any way i let atticus know i knew jem would personally never speak to me again school started and so did our daily trips past the radley place jem was in the seventh grade and went to high school beyond the grammarschool building i was now in the third grade and our routines were so different i only walked to school with jem in the mornings and saw him at mealtimes he went out for football but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team water buckets this he did with enthusiasm most afternoons he was seldom home before dark the radley place had ceased to terrify me but it was no less gloomy no less chilly under its great oaks and no less uninviting mr nathan radley could still be seen on a clear day walking to and from town we knew boo was there for the same old reasonnobodyd seen him carried out yet i sometimes felt a twinge of remorse when passing by the old place at ever having taken part in what must have been sheer torment to arthur radleywhat reasonable recluse wants children peeping through his shutters delivering greetings on the end of a fishingpole wandering in his collards at night and yet i remembered two indianhead pennies chewing gum soap dolls a rusty medal a broken watch and chain jem must have put them away somewhere i stopped and looked at the tree one afternoon the trunk was swelling around its cement patch the patch itself was turning yellow we had almost seen him a couple of times a good enough score for anybody but i still looked for him each time i went by maybe someday we would see him i imagined how it would be when it happened hed just be sitting in the swing when i came along hidy do mr arthur i would say as if i had said it every afternoon of my life evening jean louise he would say as if he had said it every afternoon of my life right pretty spell were having isnt it yes sir right pretty i would say and go on it was only a fantasy we would never see him he probably did go out when the moon was down and gaze upon miss stephanie crawford id have picked somebody else to look at but that was his business he would never gaze at us you arent starting that again are you said atticus one night when i expressed a stray desire just to have one good look at boo radley before i died if you are ill tell you right now stop it im too old to go chasing you off the radley property besides its dangerous you might get shot you know mr nathan shoots at every shadow he sees even shadows that leave sizefour bare footprints you were lucky not to be killed i hushed then and there at the same time i marveled at atticus this was the first he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew and it had happened years ago no only last summerno summer before last when time was playing tricks on me i must remember to ask jem so many things had happened to us boo radley was the least of our fears atticus said he didnt see how anything else could happen that things had a way of settling down and after enough time passed people would forget that tom robinsons existence was ever brought to their attention perhaps atticus was right but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke in a closed room the adults in maycomb never discussed the case with jem and me it seemed that they discussed it with their children and their attitude must have been that neither of us could help having atticus for a parent so their children must be nice to us in spite of him the children would never have thought that up for themselves had our classmates been left to their own devices jem and i would have had several swift satisfying fistfights apiece and ended the matter for good as it was we were compelled to hold our heads high and be respectively a gentleman and a lady in a way it was like the era of mrs henry lafayette dubose without all her yelling there was one odd thing though that i never understood in spite of atticuss shortcomings as a parent people were content to reelect him to the state legislature that year as usual without opposition i came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar i withdrew from them and never thought about them until i was forced to i was forced to one day in school once a week we had a current events period each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper absorb its contents and reveal them to the class this practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise delivering a short talk made him wordconscious learning his current event strengthened his memory being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the group the idea was profound but as usual in maycomb it didnt work very well in the first place few rural children had access to newspapers so the burden of current events was borne by the town children convincing the bus children more deeply that the town children got all the attention anyway the rural children who could usually brought clippings from what they called the grit paper a publication spurious in the eyes of miss gates our teacher why she frowned when a child recited from the grit paper i never knew but in some way it was associated with liking fiddling eating syrupy biscuits for lunch being a holyroller singing sweetly sings the donkey and pronouncing it dunkey all of which the state paid teachers to discourage even so not many of the children knew what a current event was little chuck little a hundred years old in his knowledge of cows and their habits was halfway through an uncle natchell story when miss gates stopped him charles that is not a current event that is an advertisement cecil jacobs knew what one was though when his turn came he went to the front of the room and began old hitler adolf hitler cecil said miss gates one never begins with old anybody yes maam he said old adolf hitler has been prosecutin the persecuting cecil nome miss gates it says herewell anyway old adolf hitler has been after the jews and hes puttin em in prisons and hes taking away all their property and he wont let any of em out of the country and hes washin all the feebleminded and washing the feebleminded yes maam miss gates i reckon they dont have sense enough to wash themselves i dont reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean well anyway hitlers started a program to round up all the halfjews too and he wants to register em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and i think this is a bad thing and thats my current event very good cecil said miss gates puffing cecil returned to his seat a hand went up in the back of the room how can he do that who do what asked miss gates patiently i mean how can hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that looks like the govamintd stop him said the owner of the hand hitler is the government said miss gates and seizing an opportunity to make education dynamic she went to the blackboard she printed democracy in large letters democracy she said does anybody have a definition us somebody said i raised my hand remembering an old campaign slogan atticus had once told me about what do you think it means jean louise equal rights for all special privileges for none i quoted very good jean louise very good miss gates smiled in front of democracy she printed we are a now class say it all together we are a democracy we said it then miss gates said thats the difference between america and germany we are a democracy and germany is a dictatorship dictatorship she said over here we dont believe in persecuting anybody persecution comes from people who are prejudiced prejudice she enunciated carefully there are no better people in the world than the jews and why hitler doesnt think so is a mystery to me an inquiring soul in the middle of the room said why dont they like the jews you reckon miss gates i dont know henry they contribute to every society they live in and most of all they are a deeply religious people hitlers trying to do away with religion so maybe he doesnt like them for that reason cecil spoke up well i dont know for certain he said theyre supposed to change money or somethin but that aint no cause to persecute em theyre white aint they miss gates said when you get to high school cecil youll learn that the jews have been persecuted since the beginning of history even driven out of their own country its one of the most terrible stories in history time for arithmetic children as i had never liked arithmetic i spent the period looking out the window the only time i ever saw atticus scowl was when elmer davis would give us the latest on hitler atticus would snap off the radio and say hmp i asked him once why he was impatient with hitler and atticus said because hes a maniac this would not do i mused as the class proceeded with its sums one maniac and millions of german folks looked to me like theyd shut hitler in a pen instead of letting him shut them up there was something else wrongi would ask my father about it i did and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didnt know the answer but its okay to hate hitler it is not he said its not okay to hate anybody atticus i said theres somethin i dont understand miss gates said it was awful hitler doin like he does she got real red in the face about it i should think she would but yes nothing sir i went away not sure that i could explain to atticus what was on my mind not sure that i could clarify what was only a feeling perhaps jem could provide the answer jem understood school things better than atticus jem was worn out from a days watercarrying there were at least twelve banana peels on the floor by his bed surrounding an empty milk bottle whatcha stuffin for i asked coach says if i can gain twentyfive pounds by year after next i can play he said this is the quickest way if you dont throw it all up jem i said i wanta ask you somethin shoot he put down his book and stretched his legs miss gates is a nice lady aint she why sure said jem i liked her when i was in her room she hates hitler a lot whats wrong with that well she went on today about how bad it was him treatin the jews like that jem its not right to persecute anybody is it i mean have mean thoughts about anybody even is it gracious no scout whats eatin you well coming out of the courthouse that night miss gates wasshe was goin down the steps in front of us you musta not seen hershe was talking with miss stephanie crawford i heard her say its time somebody taught em a lesson they were gettin way above themselves an the next thing they think they can do is marry us jem how can you hate hitler so bad an then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home jem was suddenly furious he leaped off the bed grabbed me by the collar and shook me i never wanta hear about that courthouse again ever ever you hear me you hear me dont you ever say one word to me about it again you hear now go on i was too surprised to cry i crept from jems room and shut the door softly lest undue noise set him off again suddenly tired i wanted atticus he was in the livingroom and i went to him and tried to get in his lap atticus smiled youre getting so big now ill just have to hold a part of you he held me close scout he said softly dont let jem get you down hes having a rough time these days i heard you back there atticus said that jem was trying hard to forget something but what he was really doing was storing it away for a while until enough time passed then he would be able to think about it and sort things out when he was able to think about it jem would be himself again things did settle down after a fashion as atticus said they would by the middle of october only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two maycomb citizens no there were three things and they did not directly concern usthe finchesbut in a way they did the first thing was that mr bob ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteenthirties he was the only man i ever heard of who was fired from the wpa for laziness i suppose his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry but his job lasted only as long as his notoriety mr ewell found himself as forgotten as tom robinson thereafter he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare office for his check and received it with no grace amid obscure mutterings that the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldnt permit an honest man to make a living ruth jones the welfare lady said mr ewell openly accused atticus of getting his job she was upset enough to walk down to atticuss office and tell him about it atticus told miss ruth not to fret that if bob ewell wanted to discuss atticuss getting his job he knew the way to the office the second thing happened to judge taylor judge taylor was not a sundaynight churchgoer mrs taylor was judge taylor savored his sunday night hour alone in his big house and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the writings of bob taylor no kin but the judge would have been proud to claim it one sunday night lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction judge taylors attention was wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise hush he said to ann taylor his fat nondescript dog then he realized he was speaking to an empty room the scratching noise was coming from the rear of the house judge taylor clumped to the back porch to let ann out and found the screen door swinging open a shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye and that was all he saw of his visitor mrs taylor came home from church to find her husband in his chair lost in the writings of bob taylor with a shotgun across his lap the third thing happened to helen robinson toms widow if mr ewell was as forgotten as tom robinson tom robinson was as forgotten as boo radley but tom was not forgotten by his employer mr link deas mr link deas made a job for helen he didnt really need her but he said he felt right bad about the way things turned out i never knew who took care of her children while helen was away calpurnia said it was hard on helen because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to avoid the ewells who according to helen chunked at her the first time she tried to use the public road mr link deas eventually received the impression that helen was coming to work each morning from the wrong direction and dragged the reason out of her just let it be mr link please suh helen begged the hell i will said mr link he told her to come by his store that afternoon before she left she did and mr link closed his store put his hat firmly on his head and walked helen home he walked her the short way by the ewells on his way back mr link stopped at the crazy gate ewell he called i say ewell the windows normally packed with children were empty i know every last one of yous in there alayin on the floor now hear me bob ewell if i hear one more peep outa my girl helen about not bein able to walk this road ill have you in jail before sundown mr link spat in the dust and walked home helen went to work next morning and used the public road nobody chunked at her but when she was a few yards beyond the ewell house she looked around and saw mr ewell walking behind her she turned and walked on and mr ewell kept the same distance behind her until she reached mr link deass house all the way to the house helen said she heard a soft voice behind her crooning foul words thoroughly frightened she telephoned mr link at his store which was not too far from his house as mr link came out of his store he saw mr ewell leaning on the fence mr ewell said dont you look at me link deas like i was dirt i aint jumped your first thing you can do ewell is get your stinkin carcass off my property youre leanin on it an i cant afford fresh paint for it second thing you can do is stay away from my cook or ill have you up for assault i aint touched her link deas and aint about to go with no nigger you dont have to touch her all you have to do is make her afraid an if assault aint enough to keep you locked up awhile ill get you in on the ladies law so get outa my sight if you dont think i mean it just bother that girl again mr ewell evidently thought he meant it for helen reported no further trouble i dont like it atticus i dont like it at all was aunt alexandras assessment of these events that man seems to have a permanent running grudge against everybody connected with that case i know how that kind are about paying off grudges but i dont understand why he should harbor onehe had his way in court didnt he i think i understand said atticus it might be because he knows in his heart that very few people in maycomb really believed his and mayellas yarns he thought hed be a hero but all he got for his pain was was okay well convict this negro but get back to your dump hes had his fling with about everybody now so he ought to be satisfied hell settle down when the weather changes but why should he try to burgle john taylors house he obviously didnt know john was home or he wouldntve tried only lights john shows on sunday nights are on the front porch and back in his den you dont know if bob ewell cut that screen you dont know who did it said atticus but i can guess i proved him a liar but john made him look like a fool all the time ewell was on the stand i couldnt dare look at john and keep a straight face john looked at him as if he were a threelegged chicken or a square egg dont tell me judges dont try to prejudice juries atticus chuckled by the end of october our lives had become the familiar routine of school play study jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to forget and our classmates mercifully let us forget our fathers eccentricities cecil jacobs asked me one time if atticus was a radical when i asked atticus atticus was so amused i was rather annoyed but he said he wasnt laughing at me he said you tell cecil im about as radical as cotton tom heflin aunt alexandra was thriving miss maudie must have silenced the whole missionary society at one blow for aunty again ruled that roost her refreshments grew even more delicious i learned more about the poor mrunas social life from listening to mrs merriweather they had so little sense of family that the whole tribe was one big family a child had as many fathers as there were men in the community as many mothers as there were women j grimes everett was doing his utmost to change this state of affairs and desperately needed our prayers maycomb was itself again precisely the same as last year and the year before that with only two minor changes firstly people had removed from their store windows and automobiles the stickers that said nrawe do our part i asked atticus why and he said it was because the national recovery act was dead i asked who killed it he said nine old men the second change in maycomb since last year was not one of national significance until then halloween in maycomb was a completely unorganized affair each child did what he wanted to do with assistance from other children if there was anything to be moved such as placing a light buggy on top of the livery stable but parents thought things went too far last year when the peace of miss tutti and miss frutti was shattered misses tutti and frutti barber were maiden ladies sisters who lived together in the only maycomb residence boasting a cellar the barber ladies were rumored to be republicans having migrated from clanton alabama in their ways were strange to us and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew but they wanted one and they dug one and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it misses tutti and frutti their names were sarah and frances aside from their yankee ways were both deaf miss tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence but miss frutti not about to miss anything employed an ear trumpet so enormous that jem declared it was a loudspeaker from one of those dog victrolas with these facts in mind and halloween at hand some wicked children had waited until the misses barber were thoroughly asleep slipped into their livingroom nobody but the radleys locked up at night stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein and hid it in the cellar i deny having taken part in such a thing i heard em was the cry that awoke the misses barbers neighbors at dawn next morning heard em drive a truck up to the door stomped around like horses theyre in new orleans by now miss tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days ago had purloined their furniture dark they were she said syrians mr heck tate was summoned he surveyed the area and said he thought it was a local job miss frutti said shed know a maycomb voice anywhere and there were no maycomb voices in that parlor last nightrolling their rs all over her premises they were nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate their furniture miss tutti insisted so mr tate was obliged to go ten miles out the road round up the county hounds and put them on the trail mr tate started them off at the misses barbers front steps but all they did was run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door when mr tate set them in motion three times he finally guessed the truth by noontime that day there was not a barefooted child to be seen in maycomb and nobody took off his shoes until the hounds were returned so the maycomb ladies said things would be different this year the highschool auditorium would be open there would be a pageant for the grownups applebobbing taffypulling pinning the tail on the donkey for the children there would also be a prize of twentyfive cents for the best halloween costume created by the wearer jem and i both groaned not that wed ever done anything it was the principle of the thing jem considered himself too old for halloween anyway he said he wouldnt be caught anywhere near the high school at something like that oh well i thought atticus would take me i soon learned however that my services would be required on stage that evening mrs grace merriweather had composed an original pageant entitled maycomb county ad astra per aspera and i was to be a ham she thought it would be adorable if some of the children were costumed to represent the countys agricultural products cecil jacobs would be dressed up to look like a cow agnes boone would make a lovely butterbean another child would be a peanut and on down the line until mrs merriweathers imagination and the supply of children were exhausted our only duties as far as i could gather from our two rehearsals were to enter from stage left as mrs merriweather not only the author but the narrator identified us when she called out pork that was my cue then the assembled company would sing maycomb county maycomb county we will aye be true to thee as the grand finale and mrs merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag my costume was not much of a problem mrs crenshaw the local seamstress had as much imagination as mrs merriweather mrs crenshaw took some chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham this she covered with brown cloth and painted it to resemble the original i could duck under and someone would pull the contraption down over my head it came almost to my knees mrs crenshaw thoughtfully left two peepholes for me she did a fine job jem said i looked exactly like a ham with legs there were several discomforts though it was hot it was a close fit if my nose itched i couldnt scratch and once inside i could not get out of it alone when halloween came i assumed that the whole family would be present to watch me perform but i was disappointed atticus said as tactfully as he could that he just didnt think he could stand a pageant tonight he was all in he had been in montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon he thought jem might escort me if i asked him aunt alexandra said she just had to get to bed early shed been decorating the stage all afternoon and was worn outshe stopped short in the middle of her sentence she closed her mouth then opened it to say something but no words came s matter aunty i asked oh nothing nothing she said somebody just walked over my grave she put away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension and suggested that i give the family a preview in the livingroom so jem squeezed me into my costume stood at the livingroom door called out poork exactly as mrs merriweather would have done and i marched in atticus and aunt alexandra were delighted i repeated my part for calpurnia in the kitchen and she said i was wonderful i wanted to go across the street to show miss maudie but jem said shed probably be at the pageant anyway after that it didnt matter whether they went or not jem said he would take me thus began our longest journey together the weather was unusually warm for the last day of october we didnt even need jackets the wind was growing stronger and jem said it might be raining before we got home there was no moon the street light on the corner cast sharp shadows on the radley house i heard jem laugh softly bet nobody bothers them tonight he said jem was carrying my ham costume rather awkwardly as it was hard to hold i thought it gallant of him to do so it is a scary place though aint it i said boo doesnt mean anybody any harm but im right glad youre along you know atticus wouldnt let you go to the schoolhouse by yourself jem said dont see why its just around the corner and across the yard that yards a mighty long place for little girls to cross at night jem teased aint you scared of haints we laughed haints hot steams incantations secret signs had vanished with our years as mist with sunrise what was that old thing jem said angel bright lifeindeath get off the road dont suck my breath cut it out now i said we were in front of the radley place jem said boo must not be at home listen high above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in plunging from the shrill kee kee of the sunflower bird to the irascible quaack of a bluejay to the sad lament of poor will poor will poor will we turned the corner and i tripped on a root growing in the road jem tried to help me but all he did was drop my costume in the dust i didnt fall though and soon we were on our way again we turned off the road and entered the schoolyard it was pitch black how do you know where were at jem i asked when we had gone a few steps i can tell were under the big oak because were passin through a cool spot careful now and dont fall again we had slowed to a cautious gait and were feeling our way forward so as not to bump into the tree the tree was a single and ancient oak two children could not reach around its trunk and touch hands it was far away from teachers their spies and curious neighbors it was near the radley lot but the radleys were not curious a small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games the lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance but they blinded us if anything dont look ahead scout jem said look at the ground and you wont fall you should have brought the flashlight jem didnt know it was this dark didnt look like itd be this dark earlier in the evening so cloudy thats why itll hold off a while though someone leaped at us god almighty jem yelled a circle of light burst in our faces and cecil jacobs jumped in glee behind it haaa gotcha he shrieked thought youd be comin along this way what are you doin way out here by yourself boy aint you scared of boo radley cecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents hadnt seen us then had ventured down this far because he knew good and well wed be coming along he thought mr finchd be with us though shucks aint much but around the corner said jem whos scared to go around the corner we had to admit that cecil was pretty good though he had given us a fright and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse that was his privilege say i said aint you a cow tonight wheres your costume its up behind the stage he said mrs merriweather says the pageant aint comin on for a while you can put yours back of the stage by mine scout and we can go with the rest of em this was an excellent idea jem thought he also thought it a good thing that cecil and i would be together this way jem would be left to go with people his own age when we reached the auditorium the whole town was there except atticus and the ladies worn out from decorating and the usual outcasts and shutins most of the county it seemed was there the hall was teeming with slickedup country people the high school building had a wide downstairs hallway people milled around booths that had been installed along each side oh jem i forgot my money i sighed when i saw them atticus didnt jem said heres thirty cents you can do six things see you later on okay i said quite content with thirty cents and cecil i went with cecil down to the front of the auditorium through a door on one side and backstage i got rid of my ham costume and departed in a hurry for mrs merriweather was standing at a lectern in front of the first row of seats making lastminute frenzied changes in the script how much money you got i asked cecil cecil had thirty cents too which made us even we squandered our first nickels on the house of horrors which scared us not at all we entered the black seventhgrade room and were led around by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects alleged to be component parts of a human being heres his eyes we were told when we touched two peeled grapes on a saucer heres his heart which felt like raw liver these are his innards and our hands were thrust into a plate of cold spaghetti cecil and i visited several booths we each bought a sack of mrs judge taylors homemade divinity i wanted to bob for apples but cecil said it wasnt sanitary his mother said he might catch something from everybodys heads having been in the same tub aint anything around town now to catch i protested but cecil said his mother said it was unsanitary to eat after folks i later asked aunt alexandra about this and she said people who held such views were usually climbers we were about to purchase a blob of taffy when mrs merriweathers runners appeared and told us to go backstage it was time to get ready the auditorium was filling with people the maycomb county high school band had assembled in front below the stage the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain rippled and billowed from the scurrying going on behind it backstage cecil and i found the narrow hallway teeming with people adults in homemade threecorner hats confederate caps spanishamerican war hats and world war helmets children dressed as various agricultural enterprises crowded around the one small window somebodys mashed my costume i wailed in dismay mrs merriweather galloped to me reshaped the chicken wire and thrust me inside you all right in there scout asked cecil you sound so far off like you was on the other side of a hill you dont sound any nearer i said the band played the national anthem and we heard the audience rise then the bass drum sounded mrs merriweather stationed behind her lectern beside the band said maycomb county ad astra per aspera the bass drum boomed again that means said mrs merriweather translating for the rustic elements from the mud to the stars she added unnecessarily it seemed to me a pageant reckon they wouldnt know what it was if she didnt tell em whispered cecil who was immediately shushed the whole town knows it i breathed but the country folksve come in cecil said be quiet back there a mans voice ordered and we were silent the bass drum went boom with every sentence mrs merriweather uttered she chanted mournfully about maycomb county being older than the state that it was a part of the mississippi and alabama territories that the first white man to set foot in the virgin forests was the probate judges greatgrandfather five times removed who was never heard of again then came the fearless colonel maycomb for whom the county was named andrew jackson appointed him to a position of authority and colonel maycombs misplaced selfconfidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all who rode with him in the creek indian wars colonel maycomb persevered in his efforts to make the region safe for democracy but his first campaign was his last his orders relayed to him by a friendly indian runner were to move south after consulting a tree to ascertain from its lichen which way was south and taking no lip from the subordinates who ventured to correct him colonel maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were eventually rescued by settlers moving inland mrs merriweather gave a thirtyminute description of colonel maycombs exploits i discovered that if i bent my knees i could tuck them under my costume and more or less sit i sat down listened to mrs merriweathers drone and the bass drums boom and was soon fast asleep they said later that mrs merriweather was putting her all into the grand finale that she had crooned poork with a confidence born of pine trees and butterbeans entering on cue she waited a few seconds then called poork when nothing materialized she yelled pork i must have heard her in my sleep or the band playing dixie woke me but it was when mrs merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that i chose to make my entrance chose is incorrect i thought id better catch up with the rest of them they told me later that judge taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood there slapping his knees so hard mrs taylor brought him a glass of water and one of his pills mrs merriweather seemed to have a hit everybody was cheering so but she caught me backstage and told me i had ruined her pageant she made me feel awful but when jem came to fetch me he was sympathetic he said he couldnt see my costume much from where he was sitting how he could tell i was feeling bad under my costume i dont know but he said i did all right i just came in a little late that was all jem was becoming almost as good as atticus at making you feel right when things went wrong almostnot even jem could make me go through that crowd and he consented to wait backstage with me until the audience left you wanta take it off scout he asked naw ill just keep it on i said i could hide my mortification under it you all want a ride home someone asked no sir thank you i heard jem say its just a little walk be careful of haints the voice said better still tell the haints to be careful of scout there arent many folks left now jem told me lets go we went through the auditorium to the hallway then down the steps it was still black dark the remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building and their headlights were little help if some of em were goin in our direction we could see better said jem here scout let me hold onto yourhock you might lose your balance i can see all right yeah but you might lose your balance i felt a slight pressure on my head and assumed that jem had grabbed that end of the ham you got me uh huh we began crossing the black schoolyard straining to see our feet jem i said i forgot my shoes theyre back behind the stage well lets go get em but as we turned around the auditorium lights went off you can get em tomorrow he said but tomorrows sunday i protested as jem turned me homeward you can get the janitor to let you in scout hm nothing jem hadnt started that in a long time i wondered what he was thinking hed tell me when he wanted to probably when we got home i felt his fingers press the top of my costume too hard it seemed i shook my head jem you dont hafta hush a minute scout he said pinching me we walked along silently minutes up i said whatcha thinkin about i turned to look at him but his outline was barely visible thought i heard something he said stop a minute we stopped hear anything he asked no we had not gone five paces before he made me stop again jem are you tryin to scare me you know im too old be quiet he said and i knew he was not joking the night was still i could hear his breath coming easily beside me occasionally there was a sudden breeze that hit my bare legs but it was all that remained of a promised windy night this was the stillness before a thunderstorm we listened heard an old dog just then i said its not that jem answered i hear it when were walkin along but when we stop i dont hear it you hear my costume rustlin aw its just halloween got you i said it more to convince myself than jem for sure enough as we began walking i heard what he was talking about it was not my costume its just old cecil said jem presently he wont get us again lets dont let him think were hurrying we slowed to a crawl i asked jem how cecil could follow us in this dark looked to me like hed bump into us from behind i can see you scout jem said how i cant see you your fat streaks are showin mrs crenshaw painted em with some of that shiny stuff so theyd show up under the footlights i can see you pretty well an i expect cecil can see you well enough to keep his distance i would show cecil that we knew he was behind us and we were ready for him cecil jacobs is a big wet heen i yelled suddenly turning around we stopped there was no acknowledgement save heen bouncing off the distant schoolhouse wall ill get him said jem hey hayehayehayey answered the schoolhouse wall it was unlike cecil to hold out for so long once he pulled a joke hed repeat it time and again we should have been leapt at already jem signaled for me to stop again he said softly scout can you take that thing off i think so but i aint got anything on under it much ive got your dress here i cant get it on in the dark okay he said never mind jem are you afraid no think were almost to the tree now few yards from that an well be to the road we can see the street light then jem was talking in an unhurried flat toneless voice i wondered how long he would try to keep the cecil myth going you reckon we oughta sing jem no be real quiet again scout we had not increased our pace jem knew as well as i that it was difficult to walk fast without stumping a toe tripping on stones and other inconveniences and i was barefooted maybe it was the wind rustling the trees but there wasnt any wind and there werent any trees except the big oak our company shuffled and dragged his feet as if wearing heavy shoes whoever it was wore thick cotton pants what i thought were trees rustling was the soft swish of cotton on cotton wheek wheek with every step i felt the sand go cold under my feet and i knew we were near the big oak jem pressed my head we stopped and listened shufflefoot had not stopped with us this time his trousers swished softly and steadily then they stopped he was running running toward us with no childs steps run scout run run jem screamed i took one giant step and found myself reeling my arms useless in the dark i could not keep my balance jem jem help me jem something crushed the chicken wire around me metal ripped on metal and i fell to the ground and rolled as far as i could floundering to escape my wire prison from somewhere near by came scuffling kicking sounds sounds of shoes and flesh scraping dirt and roots someone rolled against me and i felt jem he was up like lightning and pulling me with him but though my head and shoulders were free i was so entangled we didnt get very far we were nearly to the road when i felt jems hand leave me felt him jerk backwards to the ground more scuffling and there came a dull crunching sound and jem screamed i ran in the direction of jems scream and sank into a flabby male stomach its owner said uff and tried to catch my arms but they were tightly pinioned his stomach was soft but his arms were like steel he slowly squeezed the breath out of me i could not move suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground almost carrying me with him i thought jems up ones mind works very slowly at times stunned i stood there dumbly the scuffling noises were dying someone wheezed and the night was still again still but for a man breathing heavily breathing heavily and staggering i thought he went to the tree and leaned against it he coughed violently a sobbing boneshaking cough jem there was no answer but the mans heavy breathing jem jem didnt answer the man began moving around as if searching for something i heard him groan and pull something heavy along the ground it was slowly coming to me that there were now four people under the tree atticus the man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road i went to where i thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground reaching out with my toes presently i touched someone jem my toes touched trousers a belt buckle buttons something i could not identify a collar and a face a prickly stubble on the face told me it was not jems i smelled stale whiskey i made my way along in what i thought was the direction of the road i was not sure because i had been turned around so many times but i found it and looked down to the street light a man was passing under it the man was walking with the staccato steps of someone carrying a load too heavy for him he was going around the corner he was carrying jem jems arm was dangling crazily in front of him by the time i reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard light from our front door framed atticus for an instant he ran down the steps and together he and the man took jem inside i was at the front door when they were going down the hall aunt alexandra was running to meet me call dr reynolds atticuss voice came sharply from jems room wheres scout here she is aunt alexandra called pulling me along with her to the telephone she tugged at me anxiously im all right aunty i said you better call she pulled the receiver from the hook and said eula may get dr reynolds quick agnes is your father home oh god where is he please tell him to come over here as soon as he comes in please its urgent there was no need for aunt alexandra to identify herself people in maycomb knew each others voices atticus came out of jems room the moment aunt alexandra broke the connection atticus took the receiver from her he rattled the

if hes still around doubt if youll find him now but id like to see him if you do got to go now thanks heck atticus is jem dead no scout look after her sister he called as he went down the hall aunt alexandras fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire from around me are you all right darling she asked over and over as she worked me free it was a relief to be out my arms were beginning to tingle and they were red with small hexagonal marks i rubbed them and they felt better aunty is jem dead nono darling hes unconscious we wont know how badly hes hurt until dr reynolds gets here jean louise what happened i dont know she left it at that she brought me something to put on and had i thought about it then i would have never let her forget it in her distraction aunty brought me my overalls put these on darling she said handing me the garments she most despised she rushed back to jems room then came to me in the hall she patted me vaguely and went back to jems room a car stopped in front of the house i knew dr reynoldss step almost as well as my fathers he had brought jem and me into the world had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time jem fell out of the treehouse and he had never lost our friendship dr reynolds said if we had been boilprone things would have been different but we doubted it he came in the door and said good lord he walked toward me said youre still standing and changed his course he knew every room in the house he also knew that if i was in bad shape so was jem after ten forevers dr reynolds returned is jem dead i asked far from it he said squatting down to me hes got a bump on the head just like yours and a broken arm scout look that wayno dont turn your head roll your eyes now look over yonder hes got a bad break so far as i can tell now its in the elbow like somebody tried to wring his arm off now look at me then hes not dead noo dr reynolds got to his feet we cant do much tonight he said except try to make him as comfortable as we can well have to xray his armlooks like hell be wearing his arm way out by his side for a while dont worry though hell be as good as new boys his age bounce while he was talking dr reynolds had been looking keenly at me lightly fingering the bump that was coming on my forehead you dont feel broke anywhere do you dr reynoldss small joke made me smile then you dont think hes dead then he put on his hat now i may be wrong of course but i think hes very alive shows all the symptoms of it go have a look at him and when i come back well get together and decide dr reynoldss step was young and brisk mr heck tates was not his heavy boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly but he said the same thing dr reynolds said when he came in you all right scout he added yes sir im goin in to see jem atticusnthems in there ill go with you said mr tate aunt alexandra had shaded jems reading light with a towel and his room was dim jem was lying on his back there was an ugly mark along one side of his face his left arm lay out from his body his elbow was bent slightly but in the wrong direction jem was frowning jem atticus spoke he cant hear you scout hes out like a light he was coming around but dr reynolds put him out again yes sir i retreated jems room was large and square aunt alexandra was sitting in a rockingchair by the fireplace the man who brought jem in was standing in a corner leaning against the wall he was some countryman i did not know he had probably been at the pageant and was in the vicinity when it happened he must have heard our screams and come running atticus was standing by jems bed mr heck tate stood in the doorway his hat was in his hand and a flashlight bulged from his pants pocket he was in his working clothes come in heck said atticus did you find anything i cant conceive of anyone lowdown enough to do a thing like this but i hope you found him mr tate sniffed he glanced sharply at the man in the corner nodded to him then looked around the roomat jem at aunt alexandra then at atticus sit down mr finch he said pleasantly atticus said lets all sit down have that chair heck ill get another one from the livingroom mr tate sat in jems desk chair he waited until atticus returned and settled himself i wondered why atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner but atticus knew the ways of country people far better than i some of his rural clients would park their longeared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the back yard and atticus would often keep appointments on the back steps this one was probably more comfortable where he was mr finch said mr tate tell you what i found i found a little girls dressits out there in my car that your dress scout yes sir if its a pink one with smockin i said mr tate was behaving as if he were on the witness stand he liked to tell things his own way untrammeled by state or defense and sometimes it took him a while i found some funnylooking pieces of muddycolored cloth thats mcostume mr tate mr tate ran his hands down his thighs he rubbed his left arm and investigated jems mantelpiece then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace his fingers sought his long nose what is it heck said atticus mr tate found his neck and rubbed it bob ewells lyin on the ground under that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs hes dead mr finch aunt alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece mr tate rose but she declined assistance for once in his life atticuss instinctive courtesy failed him he sat where he was somehow i could think of nothing but mr bob ewell saying hed get atticus if it took him the rest of his life mr ewell almost got him and it was the last thing he did are you sure atticus said bleakly hes dead all right said mr tate hes good and dead he wont hurt these children again i didnt mean that atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep his age was beginning to show his one sign of inner turmoil the strong line of his jaw melted a little one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears one noticed not his jetblack hair but the gray patches growing at his temples hadnt we better go to the livingroom aunt alexandra said at last if you dont mind said mr tate id rather us stay in here if it wont hurt jem any i want to have a look at his injuries while scout tells us about it is it all right if i leave she asked im just one person too many in here ill be in my room if you want me atticus aunt alexandra went to the door but she stopped and turned atticus i had a feeling about this tonightithis is my fault she began i should have mr tate held up his hand you go ahead miss alexandra i know its been a shock to you and dont you fret yourself about anything why if we followed our feelings all the time wed be like cats chasin their tails miss scout see if you can tell us what happened while its still fresh in your mind you think you can did you see him following you i went to atticus and felt his arms go around me i buried my head in his lap we started home i said jem ive forgot mshoes soons we started back for em the lights went out jem said i could get em tomorrow scout raise up so mr tate can hear you atticus said i crawled into his lap then jem said hush a minute i thought he was thinkinhe always wants you to hush so he can thinkthen he said he heard somethin we thought it was cecil cecil cecil jacobs he scared us once tonight an we thought it was him again he had on a sheet they gave a quarter for the best costume i dont know who won it where were you when you thought it was cecil just a little piece from the schoolhouse i yelled somethin at him you yelled what cecil jacobs is a big fat hen i think we didnt hear nothinthen jem yelled hello or somethin loud enough to wake the dead just a minute scout said mr tate mr finch did you hear them atticus said he didnt he had the radio on aunt alexandra had hers going in her bedroom he remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she could hear hers atticus smiled i always play a radio too loud i wonder if the neighbors heard anything said mr tate i doubt it heck most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the chickens maudie atkinson may have been up but i doubt it go ahead scout mr tate said well after jem yelled we walked on mr tate i was shut up in my costume but i could hear it myself then footsteps i mean they walked when we walked and stopped when we stopped jem said he could see me because mrs crenshaw put some kind of shiny paint on my costume i was a ham hows that asked mr tate startled atticus described my role to mr tate plus the construction of my garment you should have seen her when she came in he said it was crushed to a pulp mr tate rubbed his chin i wondered why he had those marks on him his sleeves were perforated with little holes there were one or two little puncture marks on his arms to match the holes let me see that thing if you will sir atticus fetched the remains of my costume mr tate turned it over and bent it around to get an idea of its former shape this thing probably saved her life he said look he pointed with a long forefinger a shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire bob ewell meant business mr tate muttered he was out of his mind said atticus dont like to contradict you mr finchwasnt crazy mean as hell lowdown skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children hed never have met you face to face atticus shook his head i cant conceive of a man whod mr finch theres just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to em even then they aint worth the bullet it takes to shoot em ewell as one of em atticus said i thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me even if he hadnt i thought hed come after me he had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman he had guts enough to pester judge taylor when he thought the house was empty so do you think heda met you to your face in daylight mr tate sighed wed better get on scout you heard him behind you yes sir when we got under the tree howd you know you were under the tree you couldnt see thunder out there i was barefooted and jem says the grounds always cooler under a tree well have to make him a deputy go ahead then all of a sudden somethin grabbed me an mashed my costume think i ducked on the ground heard a tusslin under the tree sort of they were bammin against the trunk sounded like jem found me and started pullin me toward the road somemr ewell yanked him down i reckon they tussled some more and then there was this funny noisejem hollered i stopped that was jems arm anyway jem hollered and i didnt hear him any more an the next thingmr ewell was tryin to squeeze me to death i reckon then somebody yanked mr ewell down jem must have got up i guess thats all i know and then mr tate was looking at me sharply somebody was staggerin around and pantin andcoughing fit to die i thought it was jem at first but it didnt sound like him so i went lookin for jem on the ground i thought atticus had come to help us and had got wore out who was it why there he is mr tate he can tell you his name as i said it i half pointed to the man in the corner but brought my arm down quickly lest atticus reprimand me for pointing it was impolite to point he was still leaning against the wall he had been leaning against the wall when i came into the room his arms folded across his chest as i pointed he brought his arms down and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall they were white hands sickly white hands that had never seen the sun so white they stood out garishly against the dull cream wall in the dim light of jems room i looked from his hands to his sandstained khaki pants my eyes traveled up his thin frame to his torn denim shirt his face was as white as his hands but for a shadow on his jutting chin his cheeks were thin to hollowness his mouth was wide there were shallow almost delicate indentations at his temples and his gray eyes were so colorless i thought he was blind his hair was dead and thin almost feathery on top of his head when i pointed to him his palms slipped slightly leaving greasy sweat streaks on the wall and he hooked his thumbs in his belt a strange small spasm shook him as if he heard fingernails scrape slate but as i gazed at him in wonder the tension slowly drained from his face his lips parted into a timid smile and our neighbors image blurred with my sudden tears hey boo i said mr arthur honey said atticus gently correcting me jean louise this is mr arthur radley i believe he already knows you if atticus could blandly introduce me to boo radley at a time like this wellthat was atticus boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where jem was sleeping for the same shy smile crept across his face hot with embarrassment i tried to cover up by covering jem up ahah dont touch him atticus said mr heck tate sat looking intently at boo through his hornrimmed glasses he was about to speak when dr reynolds came down the hall everybody out he said as he came in the door evenin arthur didnt notice you the first time i was here dr reynoldss voice was as breezy as his step as though he had said it every evening of his life an announcement that astounded me even more than being in the same room with boo radley of course even boo radley got sick sometimes i thought but on the other hand i wasnt sure dr reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper he put it down on jems desk and took off his coat youre quite satisfied hes alive now tell you how i knew when i tried to examine him he kicked me had to put him out good and proper to touch him so scat he said to me er said atticus glancing at boo heck lets go out on the front porch there are plenty of chairs out there and its still warm enough i wondered why atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom then i understood the livingroom lights were awfully strong we filed out first mr tateatticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him then he changed his mind and followed mr tate people have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions i was no exception come along mr arthur i heard myself saying you dont know the house real well ill just take you to the porch sir he looked down at me and nodded i led him through the hall and past the livingroom wont you have a seat mr arthur this rockingchairs nice and comfortable my small fantasy about him was alive again he would be sitting on the porch right pretty spell were having isnt it mr arthur yes a right pretty spell feeling slightly unreal i led him to the chair farthest from atticus and mr tate it was in deep shadow boo would feel more comfortable in the dark atticus was sitting in the swing and mr tate was in a chair next to him the light from the livingroom windows was strong on them i sat beside boo well heck atticus was saying i guess the thing to dogood lord im losing my memory atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his eyes jems not quite thirteen no hes already thirteeni cant remember anyway itll come before county court what will mr finch mr tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward of course it was clearcut self defense but ill have to go to the office and hunt up mr finch do you think jem killed bob ewell do you think that you heard what scout said theres no doubt about it she said jem got up and yanked him off herhe probably got hold of ewells knife somehow in the dark well find out tomorrow mister finch hold on said mr tate jem never stabbed bob ewell atticus was silent for a moment he looked at mr tate as if he appreciated what he said but atticus shook his head heck its mighty kind of you and i know youre doing it from that good heart of yours but dont start anything like that mr tate got up and went to the edge of the porch he spat into the shrubbery then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced atticus like what he said im sorry if i spoke sharply heck atticus said simply but nobodys hushing this up i dont live that way nobodys gonna hush anything up mr finch mr tates voice was quiet but his boots were planted so solidly on the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there a curious contest the nature of which eluded me was developing between my father and the sheriff it was atticuss turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch he said hrm and spat dryly into the yard he put his hands in his pockets and faced mr tate heck you havent said it but i know what youre thinking thank you for it jean louise he turned to me you said jem yanked mr ewell off you yes sir thats what i thought i see there heck thank you from the bottom of my heart but i dont want my boy starting out with something like this over his head best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open let the county come and bring sandwiches i dont want him growing up with a whisper about him i dont want anybody saying jem finch his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that sooner we get this over with the better mr finch mr tate said stolidly bob ewell fell on his knife he killed himself atticus walked to the corner of the porch he looked at the wisteria vine in his own way i thought each was as stubborn as the other i wondered who would give in first atticuss stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident but in some ways he was as set as the cunninghams mr tates was unschooled and blunt but it was equal to my fathers heck atticuss back was turned if this things hushed up itll be a simple denial to jem of the way ive tried to raise him sometimes i think im a total failure as a parent but im all theyve got before jem looks at anyone else he looks at me and ive tried to live so i can look squarely back at him if i connived at something like this frankly i couldnt meet his eye and the day i cant do that ill know ive lost him i dont want to lose him and scout because theyre all ive got mr finch mr tate was still planted to the floorboards bob ewell fell on his knife i can prove it atticus wheeled around his hands dug into his pockets heck cant you even try to see it my way youve got children of your own but im older than you when mine are grown ill be an old man if im still around but right now imif they dont trust me they wont trust anybody jem and scout know what happened if they hear of me saying downtown something different happenedheck i wont have them any more i cant live one way in town and another way in my home mr tate rocked on his heels and said patiently hed flung jem down he stumbled over a root under that tree andlook i can show you mr tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife as he did so dr reynolds came to the door the sondeceaseds under that tree doctor just inside the schoolyard got a flashlight better have this one i can ease around and turn my car lights on said dr reynolds but he took mr tates flashlight jems all right he wont wake up tonight i hope so dont worry that the knife that killed him heck no sir still in him looked like a kitchen knife from the handle ken oughta be there with the hearse by now doctor night mr tate flicked open the knife it was like this he said he held the knife and pretended to stumble as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him see there stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs his whole weight drove it in mr tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket scout is eight years old he said she was too scared to know exactly what went on youd be surprised atticus said grimly im not sayin she made it up im sayin she was too scared to know exactly what happened it was mighty dark out there black as ink d take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness i wont have it atticus said softly god damn it im not thinking of jem mr tates boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in miss maudies bedroom went on miss stephanie crawfords lights went on atticus and mr tate looked across the street then at each other they waited when mr tate spoke again his voice was barely audible mr finch i hate to fight you when youre like this youve been under a strain tonight no man should ever have to go through why you aint in the bed from it i dont know but i do know that for once you havent been able to put two and two together and weve got to settle this tonight because tomorrowll be too late bob ewells got a kitchen knife in his craw mr tate added that atticus wasnt going to stand there and maintain that any boy jems size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark heck said atticus abruptly that was a switchblade you were waving whered you get it took it off a drunk man mr tate answered coolly i was trying to remember mr ewell was on me then he went down jem must have gotten up at least i thought heck i said i took it off a drunk man downtown tonight ewell probably found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere honed it down and bided his time just bided his time atticus made his way to the swing and sat down his hands dangled limply between his knees he was looking at the floor he had moved with the same slowness that night in front of the jail when i thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair mr tate clumped softly around the porch it aint your decision mr finch its all mine its my decision and my responsibility for once if you dont see it my way theres not much you can do about it if you wanta try ill call you a liar to your face your boy never stabbed bob ewell he said slowly didnt come near a mile of it and now you know it all he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely home mr tate stopped pacing he stopped in front of atticus and his back was to us im not a very good man sir but i am sheriff of maycomb county lived in this town all my life an im goin on fortythree years old know everything thats happened here since before i was born theres a black boy dead for no reason and the man responsible for its dead let the dead bury the dead this time mr finch let the dead bury the dead mr tate went to the swing and picked up his hat it was lying beside atticus mr tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on i never heard tell that its against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed which is exactly what he did but maybe youll say its my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up know whatd happen then all the ladies in maycomb includin my wifed be knocking on his door bringing angel food cakes to my way of thinkin mr finch taking the one man whos done you and this town a great service an draggin him with his shy ways into the limelightto me thats a sin its a sin and im not about to have it on my head if it was any other man itd be different but not this man mr finch mr tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot he pulled his nose then he massaged his left arm i may not be much mr finch but im still sheriff of maycomb county and bob ewell fell on his knife good night sir mr tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard his car door slammed and he drove away atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time finally he raised his head scout he said mr ewell fell on his knife can you possibly understand atticus looked like he needed cheering up i ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might yes sir i understand i reassured him mr tate was right atticus disengaged himself and looked at me what do you mean well itd be sort of like shootin a mockingbird wouldnt it atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it when he got up and walked across the porch into the shadows his youthful step had returned before he went inside the house he stopped in front of boo radley thank you for my children arthur he said when boo radley shuffled to his feet light from the livingroom windows glistened on his forehead every move he made was uncertain as if he were not sure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched he coughed his dreadful raling cough and was so shaken he had to sit down again his hand searched for his hip pocket and he pulled out a handkerchief he coughed into it then he wiped his forehead having been so accustomed to his absence i found it incredible that he had been sitting beside me all this time present he had not made a sound once more he got to his feet he turned to me and nodded toward the front door youd like to say good night to jem wouldnt you mr arthur come right in i led him down the hall aunt alexandra was sitting by jems bed come in arthur she said hes still asleep dr reynolds gave him a heavy sedative jean louise is your father in the livingroom yes maam i think so ill just go speak to him a minute dr reynolds left some her voice trailed away boo had drifted to a corner of the room where he stood with his chin up peering from a distance at jem i took him by the hand a hand surprisingly warm for its whiteness i tugged him a little and he allowed me to lead him to jems bed dr reynolds had made a tentlike arrangement over jems arm to keep the cover off i guess and boo leaned forward and looked over it an expression of timid curiosity was on his face as though he had never seen a boy before his mouth was slightly open and he looked at jem from head to foot boos hand came up but he let it drop to his side you can pet him mr arthur hes asleep you couldnt if he was awake though he wouldnt let you i found myself explaining go ahead boos hand hovered over jems head go on sir hes asleep his hand came down lightly on jems hair i was beginning to learn his body english his hand tightened on mine and he indicated that he wanted to leave i led him to the front porch where his uneasy steps halted he was still holding my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go will you take me home he almost whispered it in the voice of a child afraid of the dark i put my foot on the top step and stopped i would lead him through our house but i would never lead him home mr arthur bend your arm down here like that thats right sir i slipped my hand into the crook of his arm he had to stoop a little to accommodate me but if miss stephanie crawford was watching from her upstairs window she would see arthur radley escorting me down the sidewalk as any gentleman would do we came to the street light on the corner and i wondered how many times dill had stood there hugging the fat pole watching waiting hoping i wondered how many times jem and i had made this journey but i entered the radley front gate for the second time in my life boo and i walked up the steps to the porch his fingers found the front doorknob he gently released my hand opened the door went inside and shut the door behind him i never saw him again neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between boo was our neighbor he gave us two soap dolls a broken watch and chain a pair of goodluck pennies and our lives but neighbors give in return we never put back into the tree what we took out of it we had given him nothing and it made me sad i turned to go home street lights winked down the street all the way to town i had never seen our neighborhood from this angle there were miss maudies miss stephaniesthere was our house i could see the porch swingmiss rachels house was beyond us plainly visible i could even see mrs duboses i looked behind me to the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window i walked to it stood in front of it and turned around in daylight i thought you could see to the postoffice corner daylight in my mind the night faded it was daytime and the neighborhood was busy miss stephanie crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to miss rachel miss maudie bent over her azaleas it was summertime and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance the man waved and the children raced each other to him it was still summertime and the children came closer a boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him a man stood waiting with his hands on his hips summertime and his children played in the front yard with their friend enacting a strange little drama of their own invention it was fall and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of mrs duboses the boy helped his sister to her feet and they made their way home fall and his children trotted to and fro around the corner the days woes and triumphs on their faces they stopped at an oak tree delighted puzzled apprehensive winter and his children shivered at the front gate silhouetted against a blazing house winter and a man walked into the street dropped his glasses and shot a dog summer and he watched his childrens heart break autumn again and boos children needed him atticus was right one time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them just standing on the radley porch was enough the street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling as i made my way home i felt very old but when i looked at the tip of my nose i could see fine misty beads but looking crosseyed made me dizzy so i quit as i made my way home i thought what a thing to tell jem tomorrow hed be so mad he missed it he wouldnt speak to me for days as i made my way home i thought jem and i would get grown but there wasnt much else left for us to learn except possibly algebra i ran up the steps and into the house aunt alexandra had gone to bed and atticuss room was dark i would see if jem might be reviving atticus was in jems room sitting by his bed he was reading a book is jem awake yet sleeping peacefully he wont be awake until morning oh are you sittin up with him just for an hour or so go to bed scout youve had a long day well i think ill stay with you for a while suit yourself said atticus it must have been after midnight and i was puzzled by his amiable acquiescence he was shrewder than i however the moment i sat down i began to feel sleepy whatcha readin i asked atticus turned the book over something of jems called the gray ghost i was suddenly awake whyd you get that one honey i dont know just picked it up one of the few things i havent read he said pointedly read it out loud please atticus its real scary no he said youve had enough scaring for a while this is too atticus i wasnt scared he raised his eyebrows and i protested leastways not till i started telling mr tate about it jem wasnt scared asked him and he said he wasnt besides nothins real scary except in books atticus opened his mouth to say something but shut it again he took his thumb from the middle of the book and turned back to the first page i moved over and leaned my head against his knee hrm he said the gray ghost by seckatary hawkins chapter one i willed myself to stay awake but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm and his voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that i slept seconds later it seemed his shoe was gently nudging my ribs he lifted me to my feet and walked me to my room heard every word you said i muttered wasnt sleep at all s about a ship an threefingered fred n stoners boy he unhooked my overalls leaned me against him and pulled them off he held me up with one hand and reached for my pajamas with the other yeah an they all thought it was stoners boy messin up their clubhouse an throwin ink all over it an he guided me to the bed and sat me down he lifted my legs and put me under the cover an they chased him n never could catch him cause they didnt know what he looked like an atticus when they finally saw him why he hadnt done any of those things atticus he was real nice his hands were under my chin pulling up the cover tucking it around me most people are scout when you finally see them he turned out the light and went into jems room he would be there all night and he would be there when jem waked up in the morning the end
