it was a pleasure to burn it was a special pleasure to see things eaten to see things blackened and changed with the brass nozzle in his fists with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world the blood pounded in his head and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history with his symbolic helmet numbered on his stolid head and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black he strode in a swarm of fireflies he wanted above all like the old joke to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace while the flapping pigeonwinged books died on the porch and lawn of the house while the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame he knew that when he returned to the firehouse he might wink at himself a minstrel man burntcorked in the mirror later going to sleep he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles in the dark it never went away that smile it never ever went away as long as he remembered he hung up his blackbeetlecolored helmet and shined it he hung his flameproof jacket neatly he showered luxuriously and then whistling hands in pockets walked across the upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole at the last moment when disaster seemed positive he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole he slid to a squeaking halt the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs he walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the silent airpropelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of warm air an to the creamtiled escalator rising to the suburb whistling he let the escalator waft him into the still night air he walked toward the comer thinking little at all about nothing in particular before he reached the corner however he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere as if someone had called his name the last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here moving in the starlight toward his house he had felt that a moment prior to his making the turn someone had been there the air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there quietly and only a moment before he came simply turned to a shadow and let him through perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands on his face felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a persons standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant there was no understanding it each time he made the turn he saw only the white unused buckling sidewalk with perhaps on one night something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak but now tonight he slowed almost to a stop his inner mind reaching out to turn the corner for him had heard the faintest whisper breathing or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing very quietly there waiting he turned the corner the autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves her face was slender and milkwhite and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity it was a look almost of pale surprise the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them her dress was white and it whispered he almost thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked and the infinitely small sound now the white stir of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting the trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry rain the girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in surprise but instead stood regarding montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive that he felt he had said something quite wonderful but he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello and then when she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenixdisc on his chest he spoke again of course he said youre a new neighbor arent you and you must beshe raised her eyes from his professional symbolsthe fireman her voice trailed off how oddly you say that idid have known it with my eyes shut she said slowly whatthe smell of kerosene my wife always complains he laughed you never wash it off completely no you dont she said in awe he felt she was walking in a circle about him turning him end for end shaking him quietly and emptying his pockets without once moving herself kerosene he said because the silence had lengthened is nothing but perfume to me does it seem like that really of course why not she gave herself time to think of it i dont know she turned to face the sidewalk going toward their homes do you mind if i walk back with you im clarisse mcclellan clarisse guy montag come along what are you doing out so late wandering around how old are you they walked in the warmcool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air and he looked around and realized this was quite impossible so late in the year there was only the girl walking with him now her face bright as snow in the moonlight and he knew she was working his questions around seeking the best answers she could possibly give well she said im seventeen and im crazy my uncle says the two always go together when people ask your age he said always say seventeen and insane isnt this a nice time of night to walk i like to smell things and look at things and sometimes stay up all night walking and watch the sun rise they walked on again in silence and finally she said thoughtfully you know im not afraid of you at all he was surprised why should you be so many people are afraid of firemen i mean but youre just a man after all he saw himself in her eyes suspended in two shining drops of bright water himself dark and tiny in fine detail the lines about his mouth everything there as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact her face turned to him now was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it it was not the hysterical light of electricity butwhat but the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle one time when he was a child in a powerfailure his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and drew comfortably around them and they mother and son alone transformed hoping that the power might not come on again too soon and then clarisse mcclellan said do you mind if i ask how long have you worked at being a fireman since i was twenty ten years ago do you ever read any of the books you bum he laughed thats against the law oh of course its fine work monday bum millay wednesday whitman friday faulkner burn em to ashes then bum the ashes thats our official slogan they walked still further and the girl said is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them no houses have always been fireproof take my word for it strange i heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames he laughed she glanced quickly over why are you laughing i dont know he started to laugh again and stopped why you laugh when i havent been funny and you answer right off you never stop to think what ive asked you he stopped walking you are an odd one he said looking at her havent you any respect i dont mean to be insulting its just i love to watch people too much i guess well doesnt this mean anything to you he tapped the numerals stitched on his charcolored sleeve yes she whispered she increased her pace have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way youre changing the subject i sometimes think drivers dont know what grass is or flowers because they never see them slowly she said if you showed a driver a green blur oh yes hed say thats grass a pink blur thats a rosegarden white blurs are houses brown blurs are cows my uncle drove slowly on a highway once he drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days isnt that funny and sad too you think too many things said montag uneasily i rarely watch the parlor walls or go to races or fun parks so ive lots of time for crazy thoughts i guess have you seen the twohundredfootlong billboards in the country beyond town did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long but cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last i didnt know that montag laughed abruptly bet i know something else you dont theres dew on the grass in the morning he suddenly couldnt remember if he had known this or not and it made him quite irritable and if you lookshe nodded at the skytheres a man in the moon he hadnt looked for a long time they walked the rest of the way in silence hers thoughtful his a kind of clenching and uncomfortable silence in which he shot her accusing glances when they reached her house all its lights were blazing whats going on montag had rarely seen that many house lights oh just my mother and father and uncle sitting around talking its like being a pedestrian only rarer my uncle was arrested another timedid i tell youfor being a pedestrian oh were most peculiar but what do you talk about she laughed at this good night she started up her walk then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity are you happy she said am i what he cried but she was gonerunning in the moonlight her front door shut gently happy of all the nonsense he stopped laughing he put his hand into the glovehole of his front door and let it know his touch the front door slid open of course im happy what does she think im not he asked the quiet rooms he stood looking up at the ventilator grille in the hall and suddenly remembered that something lay hidden behind the grille something that seemed to peer down at him now he moved his eyes quickly away what a strange meeting on a strange night he remembered nothing like it save one afternoon a year ago when he had met an old man in the park and they had talked montag shook his head he looked at a blank wall the girls face was there really quite beautiful in memory astonishing in fact she had a very thin face like the dial of a small clock seen faintly in a dark room in the middle of a night when you waken to see the time and see the clock telling you the hour and the minute and the second with a white silence and a glowing all certainty and knowing what it has to tell of the night passing swiftly on toward further darknesses but moving also toward a new sun what asked montag of that other self the subconscious idiot that ran babbling at times quite independent of will habit and conscience he glanced back at the wall how like a mirror too her face impossible for how many people did you know that refracted your own light to you people were more oftenhe searched for a simile found one in his worktorches blazing away until they whiffed out how rarely did other peoples faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression your own innermost trembling thought what incredible power of identification the girl had she was like the eager watcher of a marionette show anticipating each flicker of an eyelid each gesture of his hand each flick of a finger the moment before it began how long had they walked together three minutes five yet how large that time seemed now how immense a figure she was on the stage before him what a shadow she threw on the wall with her slender body he felt that if his eye itched she might blink and if the muscles of his jaws stretched imperceptibly she would yawn long before he would why he thought now that i think of it she almost seemed to be waiting for me there in the street so damned late at night he opened the bedroom door it was like coming into the cold marbled room of a mausoleum after the moon had set complete darkness not a hint of the silver world outside the windows tightly shut the chamber a tombworld where no sound from the great city could penetrate the room was not empty he listened the little mosquitodelicate dancing hum in the air the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest the music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune he felt his smile slide away melt fold over and down on itself like a tallow skin like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out darkness he was not happy he was not happy he said the words to himself he recognized this as the true state of affairs he wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back without turning on the light he imagined how this room would look his wife stretched on the bed uncovered and cold like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb her eyes fixed to the ceiling by invisible threads of steel immovable and in her ears the little seashells the thimble radios tamped tight and an electronic ocean of sound of music and talk and music and talk coming in coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind the room was indeed empty every night the waves came in and bore her off on their great tides of sound floating her wideeyed toward morning there had been no night in the last two years that mildred had not swum that sea had not gladly gone down in it for the third time the room was cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe he did not wish to open the curtains and open the french windows for he did not want the moon to come into the room so with the feeling of a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air he felt his way toward his open separate and therefore cold bed an instant before his foot hit the object on the floor he knew he would hit such an object it was not unlike the feeling he had experienced before turning the corner and almost knocking the girl down his foot sending vibrations ahead received back echoes of the small barrier across its path even as the foot swung his foot kicked the object gave a dull clink and slid off in darkness he stood very straight and listened to the person on the dark bed in the completely featureless night the breath coming out of the nostrils was so faint it stirred only the furthest fringes of life a small leaf a black feather a single fiber of hair he still did not want outside light he pulled out his igniter felt the salamander etched on its silver disc gave it a flick two moonstones looked up at him in the light of his small handheld fire two pale moonstones buried in a creek of clear water over which the life of the world ran not touching them mildred her face was like a snowcovered island upon which rain might fall but it felt no rain over which clouds might pass their moving shadows but she felt no shadow there was only the singing of the thimblewasps in her tampedshut ears and her eyes all glass and breath going in and out softly faintly in and out of her nostrils and her not caring whether it came or went went or came the object he had sent tumbling with his foot now glinted under the edge of his own bed the small crystal bottle of sleepingtablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now lay uncapped and empty in the light of the tiny flare as he stood there the sky over the house screamed there was a tremendous ripping sound as if two giant hands had torn ten thousand miles of black linen down the seam montag was cut in half he felt his chest chopped down and split apart the jetbombs going over going over going over one two one two one two six of them nine of them twelve of them one and one and one and another and another and another did all the screaming for him he opened his own mouth and let their shriek come down and out between his bared teeth the house shook the flare went out in his hand the moonstones vanished he felt his hand plunge toward the telephone the jets were gone he felt his lips move brushing the mouthpiece of the phone emergency hospital a terrible whisper he felt that the stars had been pulverized by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be thought as he stood shivering in the dark and let his lips go on moving and moving they had this machine they had two machines really one of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there it drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil did it drink of the darkness did it suck out all the poisons accumulated with the years it fed in silence with an occasional sound of inner suffocation and blind searching it had an eye the impersonal operator of the machine could by wearing a special optical helmet gaze into the soul of the person whom he was pumping out what did the eye see he did not say he saw but did not see what the eye saw the entire operation was not unlike the digging of a trench in ones yard the woman on the bed was no more than a hard stratum of marble they had reached go on anyway shove the bore down slush up the emptiness if such a thing could be brought out in the throb of the suction snake the operator stood smoking a cigarette the other machine was working too the other machine was operated by an equally impersonal fellow in nonstainable reddishbrown overalls this machine pumped all of the blood from the body and replaced it with fresh blood and serum got to clean em out both ways said the operator standing over the silent woman no use getting the stomach if you dont clean the blood leave that stuff in the blood and the blood hits the brain like a mallet bang a couple of thousand times and the brain just gives up just quits stop it said montag i was just sayin said the operator are you done said montag they shut the machines up tight were done his anger did not even touch them they stood with the cigarette smoke curling around their noses and into their eyes without making them blink or squint thats fifty bucks first why dont you tell me if shell be all right sure shell be ok we got all the mean stuff right in our suitcase here it cant get at her now as i said you take out the old and put in the new and youre ok neither of you is an md why didnt they send an md from emergency hell the operators cigarette moved on his lips we get these cases nine or ten a night got so many starting a few years ago we had the special machines built with the optical lens of course that was new the rest is ancient you dont need an md case like this all you need is two handymen clean up the problem in half an hour lookhe started for the doorwe gotta go just had another call on the old earthimble ten blocks from here someone else just jumped off the cap of a pillbox call if you need us again keep her quiet we got a contrasedative in her shell wake up hungry so long and the men with the cigarettes in their straightlined mouths the men with the eyes of puffadders took up their load of machine and tube their case of liquid melancholy and the slow dark sludge of nameless stuff and strolled out the door montag sank down into a chair and looked at this woman her eyes were closed now gently and he put out his hand to feel the warmness of breath on his palm mildred he said at last there are too many of us he thought there are billions of us and thats too many nobody knows anyone strangers come and violate you strangers come and cut your heart out strangers come and take your blood good god who were those men i never saw them before in my life half an hour passed the bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have done a new thing to her her cheeks were very pink and her lips were very fresh and full of color and they looked soft and relaxed someone elses blood there if only someone elses flesh and brain and memory if only they could have taken her mind along to the drycleaners and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning if only he got up and put back the curtains and opened the windows wide to let the night air in it was two oclock in the morning was it only an hour ago clarisse mcclellan in the street and him coming in and the dark room and his foot kicking the little crystal bottle only an hour but the world had melted down and sprung up in a new and colorless form laughter blew across the mooncolored lawn from the house of clarisse and her father and mother and the uncle who smiled so quietly and so earnestly above all their laughter was relaxed and hearty and not forced in any way coming from the house that was so brightly lit this late at night while all the other houses were kept to themselves in darkness montag heard the voices talking talking talking giving talking weaving reweaving their hypnotic web montag moved out through the french windows and crossed the lawn without even thinking of it he stood outside the talking house in the shadows thinking he might even tap on their door and whisper let me come in i wont say anything i just want to listen what is it youre saying but instead he stood there very cold his face a mask of ice listening to a mans voice the uncle moving along at an easy pace well after all this is the age of the disposable tissue blow your nose on a person wad them flush them away reach for another blow wad flush everyone using everyone elses coattails how are you supposed to root for the home team when you dont even have a program or know the names for that matter what colour jerseys are they wearing as they trot out on to the field montag moved back to his own house left the window wide checked mildred tucked the covers about her carefully and then lay down with the moonlight on his cheekbones and on the frowning ridges in his brow with the moonlight distilled in each eye to form a silver cataract there one drop of rain clarisse another drop mildred a third the uncle a fourth the fire tonight one clarisse two mildred three uncle four fire one mildred two clarisse one two three four five clarisse mildred uncle fire sleepingtablets men disposable tissue coattails blow wad flush clarisse mildred uncle fire tablets tissues blow wad flush one two three one two three rain the storm the uncle laughing thunder falling downstairs the whole world pouring down the fire gushing up in a volcano all rushing on down around in a spouting roar and rivering stream toward morning i dont know anything any more he said and let a sleeplozenge dissolve on his tongue at nine in the morning mildreds bed was empty montag got up quickly his heart pumping and ran down the hall and stopped at the kitchen door toast popped out of the silver toaster was seized by a spidery metal hand that drenched it with melted butter mildred watched the toast delivered to her plate she had both ears plugged with electronic bees that were humming the hour away she looked up suddenly saw him and nodded you all right he asked she was an expert at lipreading from ten years of apprenticeship at seashell earthimbles she nodded again she set the toaster clicking away at another piece of bread montag sat down his wife said i dont know why i should be so hungry you im hungry last night he began didnt sleep well feel terrible she said god im hungry i cant figure it last night he said again she watched his lips casually what about last night dont you remember what did we have a wild party or something feel like ive a hangover god im hungry who was here a few people he said thats what i thought she chewed her toast sore stomach but im hungry as allgetout hope i didnt do anything foolish at the party no he said quietly the toaster spidered out a piece of buttered bread for him he held it in his hand feeling grateful you dont look so hot yourself said his wife in the late afternoon it rained and the entire world was dark grey he stood in the hall of his house putting on his badge with the orange salamander burning across it he stood looking up at the airconditioning vent in the hall for a long time his wife in the tv parlor paused long enough from reading her script to glance up hey she said the mans thinking yes he said i wanted to talk to you he paused you took all the pills in your bottle last night oh i wouldnt do that she said surprised the bottle was empty i wouldnt do a thing like that why would i do a thing like that she asked maybe you took two pills and forgot and took two more and forgot again and took two more and were so dopy you kept right on until you had thirty or forty of them in you heck she said what would i want to go and do a silly thing like that for i dont know he said she was quite obviously waiting for him to go i didnt do that she said never in a billion years all right if you say so he said thats what the lady said she turned back to her script whats on this afternoon he asked tiredly she didnt look up from her script again well this is a play comes on the walltowall circuit in ten minutes they mailed me my part this morning i sent in some boxtops they write the script with one part missing its a new idea the homemaker thats me is the missing part when it comes time for the missing lines they all look at me out of the three walls and i say the lines here for instance the man says what do you think of this whole idea helen and he looks at me sitting here centre stage see and i say i say she paused and ran her finger under a line in the script i think thats fine and then they go on with the play until he says do you agree to that helen and i say i sure do isnt that fun guy he stood in the hall looking at her its sure fun she said whats the play about i just told you there are these people named bob and ruth and helen oh its really fun itll be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed how long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth walltv put in its only two thousand dollars thats onethird of my yearly pay its only two thousand dollars she replied and i should think youd consider me sometimes if we had a fourth wall why itd be just like this room wasnt ours at all but all kinds of exotic peoples rooms we could do without a few things were already doing without a few things to pay for the third wall it was put in only two months ago remember is that all it was she sat looking at him for a long moment well goodbye dear goodbye he said he stopped and turned around does it have a happy ending i havent read that far he walked over read the last page nodded folded the script and handed it back to her he walked out of the house into the rain the rain was thinning away and the girl was walking in the centre of the sidewalk with her head up and the few drops falling on her face she smiled when she saw montag hello he said hello and then said what are you up to now im still crazy the rain feels good i love to walk in it i dont think id like that he said you might if you tried i never have she licked her lips rain even tastes good what do you do go around trying everything once he asked sometimes twice she looked at something in her hand whatve you got there he said i guess its the last of the dandelions this year i didnt think id find one on the lawn this late have you ever heard of rubbing it under your chin look she touched her chin with the flower laughing why if it rubs off it means im in love has it he could hardly do anything else but look well she said youre yellow under there fine lets try you now it wont work for me here before he could move she had put the dandelion under his chin he drew back and she laughed hold still she peered under his chin and frowned well he said what a shame she said youre not in love with anyone yes i am it doesnt show i am very much in love he tried to conjure up a face to fit the words but there was no face i am oh please dont look that way its that dandelion he said youve used it all up on yourself thats why it wont work for me of course that must be it oh now ive upset you i can see i have im sorry really i am she touched his elbow no no he said quickly im all right ive got to be going so say you forgive me i dont want you angry with me im not angry upset yes ive got to go to see my psychiatrist now they make me go i made up things to say i dont know what he thinks of me he says im a regular onion i keep him busy peeling away the layers im inclined to believe you need the psychiatrist said montag you dont mean that he took a breath and let it out and at last said no i dont mean that the psychiatrist wants to know why i go out and hike around in the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies ill show you my collection some day good they want to know what i do with all my time i tell them that sometimes i just sit and think but i wont tell them what ive got them running and sometimes i tell them i like to put my head back like this and let the rain fall into my mouth it tastes just like wine have you ever tried it no i you have forgiven me havent you yes he thought about it yes i have god knows why youre peculiar youre aggravating yet youre easy to forgive you say youre seventeen wellnext month how odd how strange and my wife thirty and yet you seem so much older at times i cant get over it youre peculiar yourself mr montag sometimes i even forget youre a fireman now may i make you angry again go ahead how did it start how did you get into it how did you pick your work and how did you happen to think to take the job you have youre not like the others ive seen a few i know when i talk you look at me when i said something about the moon you looked at the moon last night the others would never do that the others would walk off and leave me talking or threaten me no one has time any more for anyone else youre one of the few who put up with me thats why i think its so strange youre a fireman it just doesnt seem right for you somehow he felt his body divide itself into a hotness and a coldness a softness and a hardness a trembling and a not trembling the two halves grinding one upon the other youd better run on to your appointment he said and she ran off and left him standing there in the rain only after a long time did he move and then very slowly as he walked he tilted his head back in the rain for just a few moments and opened his mouth the mechanical hound slept but did not sleep lived but did not live in its gently humming gently vibrating softly illuminated kennel back in a dark corner of the firehouse the dim light of one in the morning the moonlight from the open sky framed through the great window touched here and there on the brass and the copper and the steel of the faintly trembling beast light flickered on bits of ruby glass and on sensitive capillary hairs in the nylonbrushed nostrils of the creature that quivered gently gently gently its eight legs spidered under it on rubberpadded paws montag slid down the brass pole he went out to look at the city and the clouds had cleared away completely and he lit a cigarette and came back to bend down and look at the hound it was like a great bee come home from some field where the honey is full of poison wildness of insanity and nightmare its body crammed with that overrich nectar and now it was sleeping the evil out of itself hello whispered montag fascinated as always with the dead beast the living beast nights when things got dull which was every night the men slid down the brass poles and set the ticking combinations of the olfactory system of the hound and let loose rats in the firehouse areaway and sometimes chickens and sometimes cats that would have to be drowned anyway and there would be betting to see which the hound would seize first the animals were turned loose three seconds later the game was done the rat cat or chicken caught half across the areaway gripped in gentling paws while a fourinch hollow steel needle plunged down from the proboscis of the hound to inject massive jolts of morphine or procaine the pawn was then tossed in the incinerator a new game began montag stayed upstairs most nights when this went on there had been a time two years ago when he had bet with the best of them and lost a weeks salary and faced mildreds in sane anger which showed itself in veins and blotches but now at night he lay in his bunk face turned to the wall listening to whoops of laughter below and the pianostring scurry of rat feet the violin squeaking of mice and the great shadowing motioned silence of the hound leaping out like a moth in the raw light finding holding its victim inserting the needle and going back to its kennel to die as if a switch had been turned montag touched the muzzle the hound growled montag jumped back the hound half rose in its kennel and looked at him with greenblue neon light flickering in its suddenly activated eyebulbs it growled again a strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle a frying sound a scraping of metal a turning of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient with suspicion no no boy said montag his heart pounding he saw the silver needle extended upon the air an inch pull back extend pull back the growl simmered in the beast and it looked at him montag backed up the hound took a step from its kennel montag grabbed the brass pole with one hand the pole reacting slid upward and took him through the ceiling quietly he stepped off in the halflit deck of the upper level he was trembling and his face was greenwhite below the hound had sunk back down upon its eight incredible insect legs and was humming to itself again its multifaceted eyes at peace montag stood letting the fears pass by the drophole behind him four men at a card table under a greenlidded light in the corner glanced briefly but said nothing only the man with the captains hat and the sign of the phoenix on his hat at last curious his playing cards in his thin hand talked across the long room montag it doesnt like me said montag what the hound the captain studied his cards come off it it doesnt like or dislike it just functions its like a lesson in ballistics it has a trajectory we decide for it it follows through it targets itself homes itself and cuts off its only copper wire storage batteries and electricity montag swallowed its calculators can be set to any combination so many amino acids so much sulphur so much butterfat and alkaline right we all know that all of those chemical balances and percentages on all of us here in the house are recorded in the master file downstairs it would be easy for someone to set up a partial combination on the hounds memory a touch of amino acids perhaps that would account for what the animal did just now reacted toward me hell said the captain irritated but not completely angry just enough memory set up in it by someone so it growled when i touched it who would do a thing like that asked the captain you havent any enemies here guy none that i know of well have the hound checked by our technicians tomorrow this isnt the first time its threatened me said montag last month it happened twice well fix it up dont worry but montag did not move and only stood thinking of the ventilator grille in the hall at home and what lay hidden behind the grille if someone here in the firehouse knew about the ventilator then mightnt they tell the hound the captain came over to the drophole and gave montag a questioning glance i was just figuring said montag what does the hound think about down there nights is it coming alive on us really it makes me cold it doesnt think anything we dont want it to think thats sad said montag quietly because all we put into it is hunting and finding and killing what a shame if thats all it can ever know beatty snorted gently hell its a fine bit of craftsmanship a good rifle that can fetch its own target and guarantees the bullseye every time thats why said montag i wouldnt want to be its next victim why you got a guilty conscience about something montag glanced up swiftly beatty stood there looking at him steadily with his eyes while his mouth opened and began to laugh very softly one two three four five six seven days and as many times he came out of the house and clarisse was there somewhere in the world once he saw her shaking a walnut tree once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumbtacked to his door every day clarisse walked him to the corner one day it was raining the next it was clear the day after that the wind blew strong and the day after that it was mild and calm and the day after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer and clarisse with her face all sunburnt by late afternoon why is it he said one time at the subway entrance i feel ive known you so many years because i like you she said and i dont want anything from you and because we know each other you make me feel very old and very much like a father now you explain she said why you havent any daughters like me if you love children so much i dont know youre joking i mean he stopped and shook his head well my wife she she just never wanted any children at all the girl stopped smiling im sorry i really thought you were having fun at my expense im a fool no no he said it was a good question its been a long time since anyone cared enough to ask a good question lets talk about something else have you ever smelled old leaves dont they smell like cinnamon here smell why yes it is like cinnamon in a way she looked at him with her clear dark eyes you always seem shocked its just i havent had time did you look at the stretchedout billboards like i told you i think so yes he had to laugh your laugh sounds much nicer than it did does it much more relaxed he felt at ease and comfortable why arent you in school i see you every day wandering around oh they dont miss me she said im antisocial they say i dont mix its so strange im very social indeed it all depends on what you mean by social doesnt it social to me means talking about things like this she rattled some chestnuts that had fallen off the tree in the front yard or talking about how strange the world is being with people is nice but i dont think its social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk do you an hour of tv class an hour of basketball or baseball or running another hour of transcription history or painting pictures and more sports but do you know we never ask questions or at least most dont they just run the answers at you bing bing bing and us sitting there for four more hours of filmteacher thats not social to me at all its a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom and them telling us its wine when its not they run us so ragged by the end of the day we cant do anything but go to bed or head for a fun park to bully people around break windowpanes in the window smasher place or wreck cars in the car wrecker place with the big steel ball or go out in the cars and race on the streets trying to see how close you can get to lampposts playing chicken and knock hubcaps i guess im everything they say i am all right i havent any friends thats supposed to prove im abnormal but everyone i know is either shouting or dancing around like wild or beating up one another do you notice how people hurt each other nowadays you sound so very old sometimes im ancient im afraid of children my own age they kill each other did it always used to be that way my uncle says no six of my friends have been shot in the last year alone ten of them died in car wrecks im afraid of them and they dont like me because im afraid my uncle says his grandfather remembered when children didnt kill each other but that was a long time ago when they had things different they believed in responsibility my uncle says do you know im responsible i was spanked when i needed it years ago and i do all the shopping and housecleaning by hand but most of all she said i like to watch people sometimes i ride the subway all day and look at them and listen to them i just want to figure out who they are and what they want and where theyre going sometimes i even go to the fun parks and ride in the jet cars when they race on the edge of town at midnight and the police dont care as long as theyre insured as long as everyone has ten thousand insurance everyones happy sometimes i sneak around and listen in subways or i listen at soda fountains and do you know what what people dont talk about anything oh they must no not anything they name a lot of cars or clothes or swimmingpools mostly and say how swell but they all say the same things and nobody says anything different from anyone else and most of the time in the cafes they have the jokeboxes on and the same jokes most of the time or the musical wall lit and all the colored patterns running up and down but its only color and all abstract and at the museums have you ever been all abstract thats all there is now my uncle says it was different once a long time back sometimes pictures said things or even showed people your uncle said your uncle said your uncle must be a remarkable man he is he certainly is well ive got to be going goodbye mr montag goodbye goodbye one two three four five six seven days the firehouse montag you shin that pole like a bird up a tree third day montag i see you came in the back door this time the hound bother you no no fourth day montag a funny thing heard tell this morning fireman in seattle purposely set a mechanical hound to his own chemical complex and let it loose what kind of suicide would you call that five six seven days and then clarisse was gone he didnt know what there was about the afternoon but it was not seeing her somewhere in the world the lawn was empty the trees empty the street empty and while at first he did not even know he missed her or was even looking for her the fact was that by the time he reached the subway there were vague stirrings of unease in him something was the matter his routine had been disturbed a simple routine true established in a short few days and yet he almost turned back to make the walk again to give her time to appear he was certain if he tried the same route everything would work out fine but it was late and the arrival of his train put a stop to his plan the flutter of cards motion of hands of eyelids the drone of the timevoice in the firehouse ceiling one thirtyfive thursday morning november th one thirtysix one thirtyseven am the tick of the playingcards on the greasy tabletop all the sounds came to montag behind his closed eyes behind the barrier he had momentarily erected he could feel the firehouse full of glitter and shine and silence of brass colors the colors of coins of gold of silver the unseen men across the table were sighing on their cards waiting one fortyfive the voiceclock mourned out the cold hour of a cold morning of a still colder year whats wrong montag montag opened his eyes a radio hummed somewhere war may be declared any hour this country stands ready to defend its the firehouse trembled as a great flight of jet planes whistled a single note across the black morning sky montag blinked beatty was looking at him as if he were a museum statue at any moment beatty might rise and walk about him touching exploring his guilt and selfconsciousness guilt what guilt was that your play montag montag looked at these men whose faces were sunburnt by a thousand real and ten thousand imaginary fires whose work flushed their cheeks and fevered their eyes these men who looked steadily into their platinum igniter flames as they lit their eternally burning black pipes they and their charcoal hair and sootcolored brows and bluishashsmeared cheeks where they had shaven close but their heritage showed montag started up his mouth opened had he ever seen a fireman that didnt have black hair black brows a fiery face and a bluesteel shaved but unshaved look these men were all mirrorimages of himself were all firemen picked then for their looks as well as their proclivities the color of cinders and ash about them and the continual smell of burning from their pipes captain beatty there rising in thunderheads of tobacco smoke beatty opening a fresh tobacco packet crumpling the cellophane into a sound of fire montag looked at the cards in his own hands iive been thinking about the fire last week about the man whose library we fixed what happened to him they took him screaming off to the asylum he wasnt insane beatty arranged his cards quietly any mans insane who thinks he can fool the government and us ive tried to imagine said montag just how it would feel i mean to have firemen burn our houses and our books we havent any books but if we did have some you got some beatty blinked slowly no montag gazed beyond them to the wall with the typed lists of a million forbidden books their names leapt in fire burning down the years under his axe and his hose which sprayed not water but kerosene no but in his mind a cool wind started up and blew out of the ventilator grille at home softly softly chilling his face and again he saw himself in a green park talking to an old man a very old man and the wind from the park was cold too montag hesitated waswas it always like this the firehouse our work i mean well once upon a time once upon a time beatty said what kind of talk is that fool thought montag to himself youll give it away at the last fire a book of fairy tales hed glanced at a single line i mean he said in the old days before homes were completely fireproofed suddenly it seemed a much younger voice was speaking for him he opened his mouth and it was clarisse mcclellan saying didnt firemen prevent fires rather than stoke them up and get them going thats rich stoneman and black drew forth their rulebooks which also contained brief histories of the firemen of america and laid them out where montag though long familiar with them might read established to burn englishinfluenced books in the colonies first fireman benjamin franklin rule answer the alarm swiftly start the fire swiftly burn everything report back to firehouse immediately stand alert for other alarms everyone watched montag he did not move the alarm sounded the bell in the ceiling kicked itself two hundred times suddenly there were four empty chairs the cards fell in a flurry of snow the brass pole shivered the men were gone montag sat in his chair below the orange dragon coughed into life montag slid down the pole like a man in a dream the mechanical hound leapt up in its kennel its eyes all green flame montag you forgot your helmet he seized it off the wall behind him ran leapt and they were off the night wind hammering about their siren scream and their mighty metal thunder it was a flaking threestorey house in the ancient part of the city a century old if it was a day but like all houses it had been given a thin fireproof plastic sheath many years ago and this preservative shell seemed to be the only thing holding it in the sky here we are the engine slammed to a stop beatty stoneman and black ran up the sidewalk suddenly odious and fat in the plump fireproof slickers montag followed they crashed the front door and grabbed at a woman though she was not running she was not trying to escape she was only standing weaving from side to side her eyes fixed upon a nothingness in the wall as if they had struck her a terrible blow upon the head her tongue was moving in her mouth and her eyes seemed to be trying to remember something and then they remembered and her tongue moved again play the man master ridley we shall this day light such a candle by gods grace in england as i trust shall never be put out enough of that said beatty where are they he slapped her face with amazing objectivity and repeated the question the old womans eyes came to a focus upon beatty you know where they are or you wouldnt be here she said stoneman held out the telephone alarm card with the complaint signed in telephone duplicate on the back have reason to suspect attic no elm city e b that would be mrs blake my neighbor said the woman reading the initials all right men lets get em next thing they were up in musty blackness swinging silver hatchets at doors that were after all unlocked tumbling through like boys all rollick and shout hey a fountain of books sprang down upon montag as he climbed shuddering up the sheer stairwell how inconvenient always before it had been like snuffing a candle the police went first and adhesivetaped the victims mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars so when you arrived you found an empty house you werent hurting anyone you were hurting only things and since things really couldnt be hurt since things felt nothing and things dont scream or whimper as this woman might begin to scream and cry out there was nothing to tease your conscience later you were simply cleaning up janitorial work essentially everything to its proper place quick with the kerosene whos got a match but now tonight someone had slipped this woman was spoiling the ritual the men were making too much noise laughing joking to cover her terrible accusing silence below she made the empty rooms roar with accusation and shake down a fine dust of guilt that was sucked in their nostrils as they plunged about it was neither cricket nor correct montag felt an immense irritation she shouldnt be here on top of everything books bombarded his shoulders his arms his upturned face a book alighted almost obediently like a white pigeon in his hands wings fluttering in the dim wavering light a page hung open and it was like a snowy feather the words delicately painted thereon in all the rush and fervor montag had only an instant to read a line but it blazed in his mind for the next minute as if stamped there with fiery steel time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine he dropped the book immediately another fell into his arms montag up here montags hand closed like a mouth crushed the book with wild devotion with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest the men above were hurling shovelfuls of magazines into the dusty air they fell like slaughtered birds and the woman stood below like a small girl among the bodies montag had done nothing his hand had done it all his hand with a brain of its own with a conscience and a curiosity in each trembling finger had turned thief now it plunged the book back under his arm pressed it tight to sweating armpit rushed out empty with a magicians flourish look here innocent look he gazed shaken at that white hand he held it way out as if he were farsighted he held it close as if he were blind montag he jerked about dont stand there idiot the books lay like great mounds of fishes left to dry the men danced and slipped and fell over them titles glittered their golden eyes falling gone kerosene they pumped the cold fluid from the numbered tanks strapped to their shoulders they coated each book they pumped rooms full of it they hurried downstairs montag staggered after them in the kerosene fumes come on woman the woman knelt among the books touching the drenched leather and cardboard reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused montag you cant ever have my books she said you know the law said beatty wheres your common sense none of those books agree with each other youve been locked up here for years with a regular damned tower of babel snap out of it the people in those books never lived come on now she shook her head the whole house is going up said beatty the men walked clumsily to the door they glanced back at montag who stood near the woman youre not leaving her here he protested she wont come force her then beatty raised his hand in which was concealed the igniter were due back at the house besides these fanatics always try suicide the patterns familiar montag placed his hand on the womans elbow you can come with me no she said thank you anyway im counting to ten said beatty one two please said montag go on said the woman three four here montag pulled at the woman the woman replied quietly i want to stay here five six you can stop counting she said she opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object an ordinary kitchen match the sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house captain beatty keeping his dignity backed slowly through the front door his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitements god thought montag how true always at night the alarm comes never by day is it because the fire is prettier by night more spectacle a better show the pink face of beatty now showed the faintest panic in the door the womans hand twitched on the single matchstick the fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her montag felt the hidden book pound like a heart against his chest go on said the woman and montag felt himself back away and away out of the door after beatty down the steps across the lawn where the path of kerosene lay like the track of some evil snail on the front porch where she had come to weigh them quietly with her eyes her quietness a condemnation the woman stood motionless beatty flicked his fingers to spark the kerosene he was too late montag gasped the woman on the porch reached out with contempt for them all and struck the kitchen match against the railing people ran out of houses all down the street they said nothing on their way back to the firehouse nobody looked at anyone else montag sat in the front seat with beatty and black they did not even smoke their pipes they sat there looking out of the front of the great salamander as they turned a corner and went silently on master ridley said montag at last what said beatty she said master ridley she said some crazy thing when we came in the door play the man she said master ridley something something something we shall this day light such a candle by gods grace in england as i trust shall never be put out said beatty stoneman glanced over at the captain as did montag startled beatty rubbed his chin a man named latimer said that to a man named nicholas ridley as they were being burnt alive at oxford for heresy on october montag and stoneman went back to looking at the street as it moved under the engine wheels im full of bits and pieces said beatty most fire captains have to be sometimes i surprise myself watch it stoneman stoneman braked the truck damn said beatty youve gone right by the comer where we turn for the firehouse who is it who would it be said montag leaning back against the closed door in the dark his wife said at last well put on the light i dont want the light come to bed he heard her roll impatiently the bedsprings squealed are you drunk she said so it was the hand that started it all he felt one hand and then the other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor he held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness his hands had been infected and soon it would be his arms he could feel the poison working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders and then the jumpover from shoulderblade to shoulderblade like a spark leaping a gap his hands were ravenous and his eyes were beginning to feel hunger as if they must look at something anything everything his wife said what are you doing he balanced in space with the book in his sweating cold fingers a minute later she said well just dont stand there in the middle of the floor he made a small sound what she asked he made more soft sounds he stumbled towards the bed and shoved the book clumsily under the cold pillow he fell into bed and his wife cried out startled he lay far across the room from her on a winter island separated by an empty sea she talked to him for what seemed a long while and she talked about this and she talked about that and it was only words like the words he had heard once in a nursery at a friends house a twoyearold child building word patterns talking jargon making pretty sounds in the air but montag said nothing and after a long while when he only made the small sounds he felt her move in the room and come to his bed and stand over him and put her hand down to feel his cheek he knew that when she pulled her hand away from his face it was wet late in the night he looked over at mildred she was awake there was a tiny dance of melody in the air her seashell was tamped in her ear again and she was listening to far people in far places her eyes wide and staring at the fathoms of blackness above her in the ceiling wasnt there an old joke about the wife who talked so much on the telephone that her desperate husband ran out to the nearest store and telephoned her to ask what was for dinner well then why didnt he buy himself an audioseashell broadcasting station and talk to his wife late at night murmur whisper shout scream yell but what would he whisper what would he yell what could he say and suddenly she was so strange he couldnt believe he knew her at all he was in someone elses house like those other jokes people told of the gentleman drunk coming home late at night unlocking the wrong door entering a wrong room and bedding with a stranger and getting up early and going to work and neither of them the wiser millie he whispered what i didnt mean to startle you what i want to know is well when did we meet and where when did we meet for what she asked i meanoriginally he knew she must be frowning in the dark he clarified it the first time we ever met where was it and when why it was at she stopped i dont know she said he was cold cant you remember its been so long only ten years thats all only ten dont get excited im trying to think she laughed an odd little laugh that went up and up funny how funny not to remember where or when you met your husband or wife he lay massaging his eyes his brow and the back of his neck slowly he held both hands over his eyes and applied a steady pressure there as if to crush memory into place it was suddenly more important than any other thing in a lifetime that he knew where he had met mildred it doesnt matter she was up in the bathroom now and he heard the water running and the swallowing sound she made no i guess not he said he tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zincoxidefaced men with the cigarettes in their straightlined mouths and the electroniceyed snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water and he wanted to call out to her how many have you taken tonight the capsules how many will you take later and not know and so on every hour or maybe not tonight tomorrow night and me not sleeping tonight or tomorrow night or any night for a long while now that this has started and he thought of her lying on the bed with the two technicians standing straight over her not bent with concern but only standing straight arms folded and he remembered thinking then that if she died he was certain he wouldnt cry for it would be the dying of an unknown a street face a newspaper image and it was suddenly so very wrong that he had begun to cry not at death but at the thought of not crying at death a silly empty man near a silly empty woman while the hungry snake made her still more empty how do you get so empty he wondered who takes it out of you and that awful flower the other day the dandelion it had summed up everything hadnt it what a shame youre not in love with anyone and why not well wasnt there a wall between him and mildred when you came down to it literally not just one wall but so far three and expensive too and the uncles the aunts the cousins the nieces the nephews that lived in those walls the gibbering pack of treeapes that said nothing nothing nothing and said it loud loud loud he had taken to calling them relatives from the very first hows uncle louis today who and aunt maude the most significant memory he had of mildred really was of a little girl in a forest without trees how odd or rather a little girl lost on a plateau where there used to be trees you could feel the memory of their shapes all about sitting in the center of the livingroom the livingroom what a good job of labeling that was now no matter when he came in the walls were always talking to mildred something must be done yes something must be done well lets not stand and talk lets do it im so mad i could spit what was it all about mildred couldnt say who was mad at whom mildred didnt quite know what were they going to do well said mildred wait around and see he had waited around to see a great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons he felt his jaw vibrate his eyes wobble in his head he was a victim of concussion when it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and neverquitetouchedbottomneverneverquiteno not quitetouchedbottom and you fell so fast you didnt touch the sides either never quite touched anything the thunder faded the music died there said mildred and it was indeed remarkable something had happened even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved and nothing had really been settled you had the impression that someone had turned on a washingmachine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum you drowned in music and pure cacophony he came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse behind him mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again well everything will be all right now said an aunt oh dont be too sure said a cousin now dont get angry whos angry you are i am youre mad why would i be mad because thats all very well cried montag but what are they mad about who are these people whos that man and whos that woman are they husband and wife are they divorced engaged what good god nothings connected up they said mildred well theythey had this fight you see they certainly fight a lot you should listen i think theyre married yes theyre married why and if it was not the three walls soon to be four walls and the dream complete then it was the open car and mildred driving a hundred miles an hour across town he shouting at her and she shouting back and both trying to hear what was said but hearing only the scream of the car at least keep it down to the minimum he yelled what she cried keep it down to fiftyfive the minimum he shouted the what she shrieked speed he shouted and she pushed it up to one hundred and five miles an hour and tore the breath from his mouth when they stepped out of the car she had the seashells stuffed in her ears silence only the wind blowing softly mildred he stirred in bed he reached over and pulled one of the tiny musical insects out of her ear mildred mildred yes her voice was faint he felt he was one of the creatures electronically inserted between the slots of the phonocolor walls speaking but the speech not piercing the crystal barrier he could only pantomime hoping she would turn his way and see him they could not touch through the glass mildred do you know that girl i was telling you about what girl she was almost asleep the girl next door what girl next door you know the highschool girl clarisse her name is oh yes said his wife i havent seen her for a few daysfour days to be exact have you seen her no ive meant to talk to you about her strange oh i know the one you mean i thought you would her said mildred in the dark room what about her asked montag i meant to tell you forgot forgot tell me now what is it i think shes gone gone whole family moved out somewhere but shes gone for good i think shes dead we couldnt be talking about the same girl no the same girl mcclellan mcclellan run over by a car four days ago im not sure but i think shes dead the family moved out anyway i dont know but i think shes dead youre not sure of it no not sure pretty sure why didnt you tell me sooner forgot four days ago i forgot all about it four days ago he said quietly lying there they lay there in the dark room not moving either of them good night she said he heard a faint rustle her hands moved the electric thimble moved like a praying mantis on the pillow touched by her hand now it was in her ear again humming he listened and his wife was singing under her breath outside the house a shadow moved an autumn wind rose up and faded away but there was something else in the silence that he heard it was like a breath exhaled upon the window it was like a faint drift of greenish luminescent smoke the motion of a single huge october leaf blowing across the lawn and away the hound he thought its out there tonight its out there now if i opened the window he did not open the window he had chills and fever in the morning you cant be sick said mildred he closed his eyes over the hotness yes but you were all right last night no i wasnt all right he heard the relatives shouting in the parlor mildred stood over his bed curiously he felt her there he saw her without opening his eyes her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw her eyes with a kind of cataract unseen but suspect far behind the pupils the reddened pouting lips the body as thin as a praying mantis from dieting and her flesh like white bacon he could remember her no other way will you bring me aspirin and water youve got to get up she said its noon youve slept five hours later than usual will you turn the parlor off he asked thats my family will you turn it off for a sick man ill turn it down she went out of the room and did nothing to the parlor and came back is that better thanks thats my favorite program she said what about the aspirin youve never been sick before she went away again well im sick now im not going to work tonight call beatty for me you acted funny last night she returned humming wheres the aspirin he glanced at the waterglass she handed him oh she walked to the bathroom again did something happen a fire is all i had a nice evening she said in the bathroom what doing the parlor what was on programs what programs some of the best ever who oh you know the bunch yes the bunch the bunch the bunch he pressed at the pain in his eyes and suddenly the odor of kerosene made him vomit mildred came in humming she was surprised whyd you do that he looked with dismay at the floor we burned an old woman with her books its a good thing the rugs washable she fetched a mop and worked on it i went to helens last night couldnt you get the shows in your own parlor sure but its nice visiting she went out into the parlor he heard her singing mildred he called she returned singing snapping her fingers softly arent you going to ask me about last night he said what about it we burned a thousand books we burned a woman well the parlor was exploding with sound we burned copies of dante and swift and marcus aurelius wasnt he a european something like that wasnt he a radical i never read him he was a radical mildred fiddled with the telephone you dont expect me to call captain beatty do you you must dont shout i wasnt shouting he was up in bed suddenly enraged and flushed shaking the parlor roared in the hot air i cant call him i cant tell him im sick why because youre afraid he thought a child feigning illness afraid to call because after a moments discussion the conversation would run so yes captain i feel better already ill be in at ten oclock tonight youre not sick said mildred montag fell back in bed he reached under his pillow the hidden book was still there mildred how would it be if well maybe i quit my job awhile you want to give up everything after all these years of working because one night some woman and her books you should have seen her millie shes nothing to me she shouldnt have had books it was her responsibility she should have thought of that i hate her shes got you going and next thing you know well be out no house no job nothing you werent there you didnt see he said there must be something in books things we cant imagine to make a woman stay in a burning house there must be something there you dont stay for nothing she was simpleminded she was as rational as you and i more so perhaps and we burned her thats water under the bridge no not water fire you ever seen a burned house it smolders for days well this firell last me the rest of my life god ive been trying to put it out in my mind all night im crazy with trying you should have thought of that before becoming a fireman thought he said was i given a choice my grandfather and father were firemen in my sleep i ran after them the parlor was playing a dance tune this is the day you go on the early shift said mildred you should have gone two hours ago i just noticed its not just the woman that died said montag last night i thought about all the kerosene ive used in the past ten years and i thought about books and for the first time i realized that a man was behind each one of the books a man had to think them up a man had to take a long time to put them down on paper and id never even thought that thought before he got out of bed it took some man a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts down looking around at the world and life and then i came along in two minutes and boom its all over let me alone said mildred i didnt do anything let you alone thats all very well but how can i leave myself alone we need not to be let alone we need to be really bothered once in a while how long is it since you were really bothered about something important about something real and then he shut up for he remembered last week and the two white stones staring up at the ceiling and the pumpsnake with the probing eye and the two soapfaced men with the cigarettes moving in their mouths when they talked but that was another mildred that was a mildred so deep inside this one and so bothered really bothered that the two women had never met he turned away mildred said well now youve done it out front of the house look whos here i dont care theres a phoenix car just driven up and a man in a black shirt with an orange snake stitched on his arm coming up the front walk captain beauty he said captain beatty montag did not move but stood looking into the cold whiteness of the wall immediately before him go let him in will you tell him im sick tell him yourself she ran a few steps this way a few steps that and stopped eyes wide when the front door speaker called her name softly softly mrs montag mrs montag someone here someone here mrs montag mrs montag someones here fading montag made sure the book was well hidden behind the pillow climbed slowly back into bed arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest halfsitting and after a while mildred moved and went out of the room and captain beatty strolled in his hands in his pockets shut the relatives up said beatty looking around at everything except montag and his wife this time mildred ran the yammering voices stopped yelling in the parlor captain beatty sat down in the most comfortable chair with a peaceful look on his ruddy face he took time to prepare and light his brass pipe and puff out a great smoke cloud just thought id come by and see how the sick man is howd you guess beatty smiled his smile which showed the candy pinkness of his gums and the tiny candy whiteness of his teeth ive seen it all you were going to call for a night off montag sat in bed well said beatty take the night off he examined his eternal matchbox the lid of which said guaranteed one million lights in this igniter and began to strike the chemical match abstractedly blow out strike blow out strike speak a few words blow out he looked at the flame he blew he looked at the smoke when will you be well tomorrow the next day maybe first of the week beatty puffed his pipe every fireman sooner or later hits this they only need understanding to know how the wheels run need to know the history of our profession they dont feed it to rookies like they used to damn shame puff only fire chiefs remember it now puff ill let you in on it mildred fidgeted beatty took a full minute to settle himself in and think back for what he wanted to say when did it all start you ask this job of ours how did it come about where when well id say it really got started around about a thing called the civil war even though our rulebook claims it was founded earlier the fact is we didnt get along well until photography came into its own thenmotion pictures in the early twentieth century radio television things began to have mass montag sat in bed not moving and because they had mass they became simpler said beatty once books appealed to a few people here there everywhere they could afford to be different the world was roomy but then the world got full of eyes and elbows and mouths double triple quadruple population films and radios magazines books leveled down to a sort of paste pudding norm do you follow me i think so beatty peered at the smoke pattern he had put out on the air picture it nineteenthcentury man with his horses dogs carts slow motion then in the twentieth century speed up your camera books cut shorter condensations digests tabloids everything boils down to the gag the snap ending snap ending mildred nodded classics cut to fit fifteenminute radio shows then cut again to fill a twominute book column winding up at last as a ten or twelveline dictionary resume i exaggerate of course the dictionaries were for reference but many were those whose sole knowledge of hamlet you know the title certainly montag it is probably only a faint rumor of a title to you mrs montag whose sole knowledge as i say of hamlet was a onepage digest in a book that claimed now at least you can read all the classics keep up with your neighbors do you see out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery theres your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more mildred arose and began to move around the room picking things up and putting them down beatty ignored her and continued speed up the film montag quick click pic look eye now flick here there swift pace up down in out why how who what where eh uh bang smack wallop bing bong boom digestdigests digestdigestdigests politics one column two sentences a headline then in midair all vanishes whirl mans mind around about so fast under the pumping hands of publishers exploiters broadcasters that the centrifuge flings off all unnecessary timewasting thought mildred smoothed the bedclothes montag felt his heart jump and jump again as she patted his pillow right now she was pulling at his shoulder to try to get him to move so she could take the pillow out and fix it nicely and put it back and perhaps cry out and stare or simply reach down her hand and say whats this and hold up the hidden book with touching innocence school is shortened discipline relaxed philosophies histories languages dropped english and spelling gradually neglected finally almost completely ignored life is immediate the job counts pleasure lies all about after work why learn anything save pressing buttons pulling switches fitting nuts and bolts let me fix your pillow said mildred no whispered montag the zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much time to think while dressing at dawn a philosophical hour and thus a melancholy hour mildred said here get away said montag life becomes one big pratfall montag everything bang boff and wow wow said mildred yanking at the pillow for gods sake let me be cried montag passionately beatty opened his eyes wide mildreds hand had frozen behind the pillow her fingers were tracing the books outline and as the shape became familiar her face looked surprised and then stunned her mouth opened to ask a question empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with glass walls and pretty colors running up and down the walls like confetti or blood or sherry or sauterne you like baseball dont you montag baseballs a fine game now beatty was almost invisible a voice somewhere behind a screen of smoke whats this asked mildred almost with delight montag heaved back against her arms whats this here sit down montag shouted she jumped away her hands empty were talking beatty went on as if nothing had happened you like bowling dont you montag bowling yes and golf golf is a fine game basketball a fine game billiards pool football fine games all of them more sports for everyone group spirit fun and you dont have to think eh organize and organize and super organize supersuper sports more cartoons in books more pictures the mind drinks less and less impatience highways full of crowds going somewhere somewhere somewhere nowhere the gasoline refugee towns turn into motels people in nomadic surges from place to place following the moon tides living tonight in the room where you slept this noon and i the night before mildred went out of the room and slammed the door the parlor aunts began to laugh at the parlor uncles now lets take up the minorities in our civilization shall we bigger the population the more minorities dont step on the toes of the doglovers the catlovers doctors lawyers merchants chiefs mormons baptists unitarians secondgeneration chinese swedes italians germans texans brooklynites irishmen people from oregon or mexico the people in this book this play this tv serial are not meant to represent any actual painters cartographers mechanics anywhere the bigger your market montag the less you handle controversy remember that all the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean authors full of evil thoughts lock up your typewriters they did magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca books so the damned snobbish critics said were dishwater no wonder books stopped selling the critics said but the public knowing what it wanted spinning happily let the comicbooks survive and the threedimensional sexmagazines of course there you have it montag it didnt come from the government down there was no dictum no declaration no censorship to start with no technology mass exploitation and minority pressure carried the trick thank god today thanks to them you can stay happy all the time you are allowed to read comics the good old confessions or trade journals yes but what about the firemen then asked montag ah beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe what more easily explained and natural with school turning out more runners jumpers racers tinkerers grabbers snatchers fliers and swimmers instead of examiners critics knowers and imaginative creators the word intellectual of course became the swear word it deserved to be you always dread the unfamiliar surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally bright did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols hating him and wasnt it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours of course it was we must all be alike not everyone born free and equal as the constitution says but everyone made equal each man the image of every other then all are happy for there are no mountains to make them cower to judge themselves against so a book is a loaded gun in the house next door burn it take the shot from the weapon breach mans mind who knows who might be the target of the well read man me i wont stomach them for a minute and so when houses were finally fireproofed completely all over the world you were correct in your assumption the other night there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes they were given the new job as custodians of our peace of mind the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior official censors judges and executors thats you montag and thats me the door to the parlor opened and mildred stood there looking in at them looking at beatty and then at montag behind her the walls of the room were flooded with green and yellow and orange fireworks sizzling and bursting to some music composed almost completely of trap drums tomtoms and cymbals her mouth moved and she was saying something but the sound covered it beatty knocked his pipe into the palm of his pink hand studied the ashes as if they were a symbol to be diagnosed and searched for meaning you must understand that our civilization is so vast that we cant have our minorities upset and stirred ask yourself what do we want in this country above all people want to be happy isnt that right havent you heard it all your life i want to be happy people say well arent they dont we keep them moving dont we give them fun thats all we live for isnt it for pleasure for titillation and you must admit our culture provides plenty of these yes montag could lipread what mildred was saying in the doorway he tried not to look at her mouth because then beatty might turn and read what was there too colored people dont like little black sambo burn it white people dont feel good about uncle toms cabin burn it someones written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs the cigarette people are weeping bum the book serenity montag peace montag take your fight outside better yet into the incinerator funerals are unhappy and pagan eliminate them too five minutes after a person is dead hes on his way to the big flue the incinerators serviced by helicopters all over the country ten minutes after death a mans a speck of black dust lets not quibble over individuals with memoriams forget them burn them all burn everything fire is bright and fire is clean the fireworks died in the parlor behind mildred she had stopped talking at the same time a miraculous coincidence montag held his breath there was a girl next door he said slowly shes gone now i think dead i cant even remember her face but she was different how how did she happen beatty smiled here or there thats bound to occur clarisse mcclellan weve a record on her family weve watched them carefully heredity and environment are funny things you cant rid yourselves of all the odd ducks in just a few years the home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school thats why weve lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now were almost snatching them from the cradle we had some false alarms on the mcclellans when they lived in chicago never found a book uncle had a mixed record antisocial the girl she was a time bomb the family had been feeding her subconscious im sure from what i saw of her school record she didnt want to know how a thing was done but why that can be em barrassing you ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed if you keep at it the poor girls better off dead yes dead luckily queer ones like her dont happen often we know how to nip most of them in the bud early you cant build a house without nails and wood if you dont want a house built hide the nails and wood if you dont want a man unhappy politically dont give him two sides to a question to worry him give him one better yet give him none let him forget there is such a thing as war if the government is inefficient topheavy and taxmad better it be all those than that people worry over it peace montag give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn iowa grew last year cram them full of noncombustible data chock them so damned full of facts they feel stuffed but absolutely brilliant with information then theyll feel theyre thinking theyll get a sense of motion without moving and theyll be happy because facts of that sort dont change dont give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with that way lies melancholy any man who can take a tv wall apart and put it back together again and most men can nowadays is happier than any man who tries to sliderule measure and equate the universe which just wont be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely i know ive tried it to hell with it so bring on your clubs and parties your acrobats and magicians your daredevils jet cars motorcycle helicopters your sex and heroin more of everything to do with automatic reflex if the drama is bad if the film says nothing if the play is hollow sting me with the theremin loudly ill think im responding to the play when its only a tactile reaction to vibration but i dont care i just like solid entertainment beatty got up i must be going lectures over i hope ive clarified things the important thing for you to remember montag is were the happiness boys the dixie duo you and i and the others we stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought we have our fingers in the dyke hold steady dont let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy drown our world we depend on you i dont think you realize how important you are we are to our happy world as it stands now beatty shook montags limp hand montag still sat as if the house were collapsing about him and he could not move in the bed mildred had vanished from the door one last thing said beatty at least once in his career every fireman gets an itch what do the books say he wonders oh to scratch that itch eh well montag take my word for it ive had to read a few in my time to know what i was about and the books say nothing nothing you can teach or believe theyre about nonexistent people figments of imagination if theyre fiction and if theyre nonfiction its worse one professor calling another an idiot one philosopher screaming down anothers gullet all of them running about putting out the stars and extinguishing the sun you come away lost well then what if a fireman accidentally really not intending anything takes a book home with him montag twitched the open door looked at him with its great vacant eye a natural error curiosity alone said beatty we dont get overanxious or mad we let the fireman keep the book twentyour hours if he hasnt burned it by then we simply come and burn it for him of course montags mouth was dry well montag will you take another later shift today will we see you tonight perhaps i dont know said montag what beatty looked faintly surprised montag shut his eyes ill be in later maybe wed certainly miss you if you didnt show said beatty putting his pipe in his pocket thoughtfully ill never come in again thought montag get well and keep well said beatty he turned and went out through the open door montag watched through the window as beatty drove away in his gleaming yellowflamecolored beetle with the black charcolored tires across the street and down the way the other houses stood with their flat fronts what was it clarisse had said one afternoon no front porches my uncle says there used to be front porches and people sat there sometimes at night talking when they wanted to talk rocking and not talking when they didnt want to talk sometimes they just sat there and thought about things turned things over my uncle says the architects got rid of the front porches because they didnt look well but my uncle says that was merely rationalizing it the real reason hidden underneath might be they didnt want people sitting like that doing nothing rocking talking that was the wrong kind of social life people talked too much and they had time to think so they ran off with the porches and the gardens too not many gardens any more to sit around in and look at the furniture no rocking chairs any more theyre too comfortable get people up and running around my uncle says and my uncle and my uncle her voice faded montag turned and looked at his wife who sat in the middle of the parlor talking to an announcer who in turn was talking to her mrs montag he was saying this that and the other mrs montag something else and still another the converter attachment which had cost them one hundred dollars automatically supplied her name whenever the announcer addressed his anonymous audience leaving a blank where the proper syllables could be filled in a special spotwavexscrambler also caused his televised image in the area immediately about his lips to mouth the vowels and consonants beautifully he was a friend no doubt of it a good friend mrs montagnow look right here her head turned though she quite obviously was not listening montag said its only a step from not going to work today to not working tomorrow to not working at the firehouse ever again you are going to work tonight though arent you said mildred i havent decided right now ive got an awful feeling i want to smash things and kill things go take the beetle no thanks the keys to the beetle are on the night table i always like to drive fast when i feel that way you get it up around ninetyfive and you feel wonderful sometimes i drive all night and come back and you dont know it its fun out in the country you hit rabbits sometimes you hit dogs go take the beetle no i dont want to this time i want to hold on to this funny thing god its gotten big on me i dont know what it is im so damned unhappy im so mad and i dont know why i feel like im putting on weight i feel fat i feel like ive been saving up a lot of things and dont know what i might even start reading books theyd put you in jail wouldnt they she looked at him as if he were behind the glass wall he began to put on his clothes moving restlessly about the bedroom yes and it might be a good idea before i hurt someone did you hear beatty did you listen to him he knows all the answers hes right happiness is important fun is everything and yet i kept sitting there saying to myself im not happy im not happy i am mildreds mouth beamed and proud of it im going to do something said montag i dont even know what yet but im going to do something big im tired of listening to this junk said mildred turning from him to the announcer again montag touched the volume control in the wall and the announcer was speechless millie he paused this is your house as well as mine i feel its only fair that i tell you something now i should have told you before but i wasnt even admitting it to myself i have something i want you to see something ive put away and hid during the past year now and again once in a while i didnt know why but i did it and i never told you he took hold of a straightbacked chair and moved it slowly and steadily into the hall near the front door and climbed up on it and stood for a moment like a statue on a pedestal his wife standing under him waiting then he reached up and pulled back the grille of the airconditioning system and reached far back inside to the right and moved still another sliding sheet of metal and took out a book without looking at it he dropped it to the floor he put his hand back up and took out two books and moved his hand down and dropped the two books to the floor he kept moving his hand and dropping books small ones fairly large ones yellow red green ones when he was done he looked down upon some twenty books lying at his wifes feet im sorry he said i didnt really think but now it looks as if were in this together mildred backed away as if she were suddenly confronted by a pack of mice that had come up out of the floor he could hear her breathing rapidly and her face was paled out and her eyes were fastened wide she said his name over twice three times then moaning she ran forward seized a book and ran toward the kitchen incinerator he caught her shrieking he held her and she tried to fight away from him scratching no millie no wait stop it will you you dont know stop it he slapped her face he grabbed her again and shook her she said his name and began to cry millie he said listen give me a second will you we cant do anything we cant burn these i want to look at them at least look at them once then if what the captain says is true well burn them together believe me well burn them together you must help me he looked down into her face and took hold of her chin and held her firmly he was looking not only at her but for himself and what he must do in her face whether we like this or not were in it ive never asked for much from you in all these years but i ask it now i plead for it weve got to start somewhere here figuring out why were in such a mess you and the medicine at night and the car and me and my work were heading right for the cliff millie god i dont want to go over this isnt going to be easy we havent anything to go on but maybe we can piece it out and figure it and help each other i need you so much right now i cant tell you if you love me at all youll put up with this twentyfour fortyeight hours thats all i ask then itll be over i promise i swear and if there is something here just one little thing out of a whole mess of things maybe we can pass it on to someone else she wasnt fighting any more so he let her go she sagged away from him and slid down the wall and sat on the floor looking at the books her foot touched one and she saw this and pulled her foot away that woman the other night millie you werent there you didnt see her face and clarisse you never talked to her i talked to her and men like beatty are afraid of her i cant understand it why should they be so afraid of someone like her but i kept putting her alongside the firemen in the house last night and i suddenly realized i didnt like them at all and i didnt like myself at all any more and i thought maybe it would be best if the firemen themselves were burnt guy the front door voice called softly mrs montag mrs montag someone here someone here mrs montag mrs montag someone here softly they turned to stare at the door and the books toppled everywhere everywhere in heaps beatty said mildred it cant be him hes come back she whispered the front door voice called again softly someone here we wont answer montag lay back against the wall and then slowly sank to a crouching position and began to nudge the books bewilderedly with his thumb his forefinger he was shivering and he wanted above all to shove the books up through the ventilator again but he knew he could not face beatty again he crouched and then he sat and the voice of the front door spoke again more insistently montag picked a single small volume from the floor where do we begin he opened the book halfway and peered at it we begin by beginning i guess hell come in said mildred and burn us and the books the front door voice faded at last there was a silence montag felt the presence of someone beyond the door waiting listening then the footsteps going away down the walk and over the lawn lets see what this is said montag he spoke the words haltingly and with a terrible selfconsciousness he read a dozen pages here and there and came at last to this it is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death rather than submit to break eggs at the smaller end mildred sat across the hall from him what does it mean it doesnt mean anything the captain was right here now said montag well start over again at the beginning the sieve and the sand they read the long afternoon through while the cold november rain fell from the sky upon the quiet house they sat in the hall because the parlor was so empty and greylooking without its walls lit with orange and yellow confetti and skyrockets and women in goldmesh dresses and men in black velvet pulling onehundredpound rabbits from silver hats the parlor was dead and mildred kept peering in at it with a blank expression as montag paced the floor and came back and squatted down and read a page as many as ten times aloud we cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed as in filling a vessel drop by drop there is at last a drop which makes it run over so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over montag sat listening to the rain is that what it was in the girl next door ive tried so hard to figure shes dead lets talk about someone alive for goodness sake montag did not look back at his wife as he went trembling along the hall to the kitchen where he stood a long time watching the rain hit the windows before he came back down the hall in the grey light waiting for the tremble to subside he opened another book that favorite subject myself he squinted at the wall the favorite subject myself i understand that one said mildred but clarisses favorite subject wasnt herself it was everyone else and me she was the first person in a good many years ive really liked she was the first person i can remember who looked straight at me as if i counted he lifted the two books these men have been dead a long time but i know their words point one way or another to clarisse outside the front door in the rain a faint scratching montag froze he saw mildred thrust herself back to the wall and gasp someonethe doorwhy doesnt the doorvoice tell us i shut it off under the doorsill a slow probing sniff an exhalation of electric steam mildred laughed its only a dog thats what you want me to shoo him away stay where you are silence the cold rain falling and the smell of blue electricity blowing under the locked door lets get back to work said montag quietly mildred kicked at a book books arent people you read and i look around but there isnt anybody he stared at the parlor that was dead and gray as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun now said mildred my family is people they tell me things i laugh they laugh and the colors yes i know and besides if captain beatty knew about those books she thought about it her face grew amazed and then horrified he might come and bum the house and the family thats awful think of our investment why should i read what for what for why said montag i saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night it was dead but it was alive it could see but it couldnt see you want to see that snake its at emergency hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you would you like to go and check their file maybe youd look under guy montag or maybe under fear or war would you like to go to that house that burnt last night and rake ashes for the bones of the woman who set fire to her own house what about clarisse mcclellan where do we look for her the morgue listen the bombers crossed the sky and crossed the sky over the house gasping murmuring whistling like an immense invisible fan circling in emptiness jesus god said montag every hour so many damn things in the sky how in hell did those bombers get up there every single second of our lives why doesnt someone want to talk about it weve started and won two atomic wars since is it because were having so much fun at home weve forgotten the world is it because were so rich and the rest of the worlds so poor and we just dont care if they are ive heard rumors the world is starving but were wellfed is it true the world works hard and we play is that why were hated so much ive heard the rumors about hate too once in a long while over the years do you know why i dont thats sure maybe the books can get us half out of the cave they just might stop us from making the same damn insane mistakes i dont hear those idiot bastards in your parlor talking about it god millie dont you see an hour a day two hours with these books and maybe the telephone rang mildred snatched the phone ann she laughed yes the white clowns on tonight montag walked to the kitchen and threw the book down montag he said youre really stupid where do we go from here do we turn the books in forget it he opened the book to read over mildreds laughter poor millie he thought poor montag its mud to you too but where do you get help where do you find a teacher this late hold on he shut his eyes yes of course again he found himself thinking of the green park a year ago the thought had been with him many times recently but now he remembered how it was that day in the city park when he had seen that old man in the black suit hide something quickly in his coat the old man leapt up as if to run and montag said wait i havent done anything cried the old man trembling no one said you did they had sat in the green soft light without saying a word for a moment and then montag talked about the weather and then the old man responded with a pale voice it was a strange quiet meeting the old man admitted to being a retired english professor who had been thrown out upon the world forty years ago when the last liberal arts college shut for lack of students and patronage his name was faber and when he finally lost his fear of montag he talked in a cadenced voice looking at the sky and the trees and the green park and when an hour had passed he said something to montag and montag sensed it was a rhyme less poem then the old man grew even more courageous and said something else and that was a poem too faber held his hand over his left coatpocket and spoke these words gently and montag knew if he reached out he might pull a book of poetry from the mans coat but he did not reach out his hands stayed on his knees numbed and useless i dont talk things sir said faber i talk the meaning of things i sit here and know im alive that was all there was to it really an hour of monologue a poem a comment and then without even acknowledging the fact that montag was a fireman faber with a certain trembling wrote his address on a slip of paper for your file he said in case you decide to be angry with me im not angry montag said surprised mildred shrieked with laughter in the hall montag went to his bedroom closet and flipped through his filewallet to the heading future investigations fabers name was there he hadnt turned it in and he hadnt erased it he dialed the call on a secondary phone the phone on the far end of the line called fabers name a dozen times before the professor answered in a faint voice montag identified himself and was met with a lengthy silence yes mr montag professor faber i have a rather odd question to ask how many copies of the bible are left in this country i dont know what youre talking about i want to know if there are any copies left at all this is some sort of a trap i cant talk to just anyone on the phone how many copies of shakespeare and plato none you know as well as i do none faber hung up montag put down the phone none a thing he knew of course from the firehouse listings but somehow he had wanted to hear it from faber himself in the hall mildreds face was suffused with excitement well the ladies are coming over montag showed her a book this is the old and new testament and dont start that again it might be the last copy in this part of the world youve got to hand it back tonight dont you know captain beatty knows youve got it doesnt he i dont think he knows which book i stole but how do i choose a substitute do i turn in mr jefferson mr thoreau which is least valuable if i pick a substitute and beatty does know which book i stole hell guess weve an entire library here mildreds mouth twitched see what youre doing youll ruin us whos more important me or that bible she was beginning to shriek now sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own heat he could hear beattys voice sit down montag watch delicately like the petals of a flower light the first page light the second page each becomes a black butterfly beautiful eh light the third page from the second and so on chainsmoking chapter by chapter all the silly things the words mean all the false promises all the secondhand notions and timeworn phi losophies there sat beatty perspiring gently the floor littered with swarms of black moths that had died in a single storm mildred stopped screaming as quickly as she started montag was not listening theres only one thing to do he said some time before tonight when i give the book to beatty ive got to have a duplicate made youll be here for the white clown tonight and the ladies coming over cried mildred montag stopped at the door with his back turned millie a silence what millie does the white clown love you no answer millie does he licked his lips does your family love you love you very much love you with all their heart and soul millie he felt her blinking slowly at the back of his neck whyd you ask a silly question like that he felt he wanted to cry but nothing would happen to his eyes or his mouth if you see that dog outside said mildred give him a kick for me he hesitated listening at the door he opened it and stepped out the rain had stopped and the sun was setting in the clear sky the street and the lawn and the porch were empty he let his breath go in a great sigh he slammed the door he was on the subway im numb he thought when did the numbness really begin in my face in my body the night i kicked the pillbottle in the dark like kicking a buried mine the numbness will go away he thought itll take time but ill do it or faber will do it for me someone somewhere will give me back the old face and the old hands the way they were even the smile he thought the old burntin smile thats gone im lost without it the subway fled past him creamtile jetblack creamtile jetblack numerals and darkness more darkness and the total adding itself once as a child he had sat upon a yellow dune by the sea in the middle of the blue and hot summer day trying to fill a sieve with sand because some cruel cousin had said fill this sieve and youll get a dime and the faster he poured the faster it sifted through with a hot whispering his hands were tired the sand was boiling the sieve was empty seated there in the midst of july without a sound he felt the tears move down his cheeks now as the vacuumunderground rushed him through the dead cellars of town jolting him he remembered the terrible logic of that sieve and he looked down and saw that he was carrying the bible open there were people in the suction train but he held the book in his hands and the silly thought came to him if you read fast and read all maybe some of the sand will stay in the sieve but he read and the words fell through and he thought in a few hours there will be beatty and here will be me handing this over so no phrase must escape me each line must be memorized i will myself to do it he clenched the book in his fists trumpets blared denhams dentrifice shut up thought montag consider the lilies of the field denhams dentifrice they toil not denhams consider the lilies of the field shut up shut up dentifrice he tore the book open and flicked the pages and felt them as if he were blind he picked at the shape of the individual letters not blinking denhams spelled den they toil not neither do they a fierce whisper of hot sand through empty sieve denhams does it consider the lilies the lilies the lilies denhams dental detergent shut up shut up shut up it was a plea a cry so terrible that montag found himself on his feet the shocked inhabitants of the loud car staring moving back from this man with the insane gorged face the gibbering dry mouth the flapping book in his fist the people who had been sitting a moment before tapping their feet to the rhythm of denhams dentifrice denhams dandy dental detergent denhams dentifrice dentifrice dentifrice one two one two three one two one two three the people whose mouths had been faintly twitching the words dentifrice dentifrice dentifrice the train radio vomited upon montag in retaliation a great tonload of music made of tin copper silver chromium and brass the people were pounded into submission they did not run there was no place to run the great airtrain fell down its shaft in the earth lilies of the field denhams lilies i said the people stared call the guard the mans off knoll view the train hissed to its stop knoll view a cry denhams a whisper montags mouth barely moved lilies the train door whistled open montag stood the door gasped started shut only then did he leap past the other passengers screaming in his mind plunge through the slicing door only in time he ran on the white tiles up through the tunnels ignoring the escalators because he wanted to feel his feetmove arms swing lungs clench unclench feel his throat go raw with air a voice drifted after him denhams denhams denhams the train hissed like a snake the train vanished in its hole who is it montag out here what do you want let me in i havent done anything im alone dammit you swear it i swear the front door opened slowly faber peered out looking very old in the light and very fragile and very much afraid the old man looked as if he had not been out of the house in years he and the white plaster walls inside were much the same there was white in the flesh of his mouth and his cheeks and his hair was white and his eyes had faded with white in the vague blueness there then his eyes touched on the book under montags arm and he did not look so old any more and not quite as fragile slowly his fear went im sorry one has to be careful he looked at the book under montags arm and could not stop so its true montag stepped inside the door shut sit down faber backed up as if he feared the book might vanish if he took his eyes from it behind him the door to a bedroom stood open and in that room a litter of machinery and steel tools was strewn upon a desktop montag had only a glimpse before faber seeing montags attention diverted turned quickly and shut the bedroom door and stood holding the knob with a trembling hand his gaze returned unsteadily to montag who was now seated with the book in his lap the bookwhere did you i stole it faber for the first time raised his eyes and looked directly into montags face youre brave no said montag my wifes dying a friend of mines already dead someone who may have been a friend was burnt less than twentyfour hours ago youre the only one i knew might help me to see to see fabers hands itched on his knees may i sorry montag gave him the book its been a long time im not a religious man but its been a long time faber turned the pages stopping here and there to read its as good as i remember lord how theyve changed it in our parlors these days christ is one of the family now i often wonder it god recognizes his own son the way weve dressed him up or is it dressed him down hes a regular peppermint stick now all sugarcrystal and saccharine when he isnt making veiled references to certain commercial products that every worshipper absolutely needs faber sniffed the book do you know that books smell like nutmeg or some spice from a foreign land i loved to smell them when i was a boy lord there were a lot of lovely books once before we let them go faber turned the pages mr montag you are looking at a coward i saw the way things were going a long time back i said nothing im one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the guilty but i did not speak and thus became guilty myself and when finally they set the structure to burn the books using the firemen i grunted a few times and subsided for there were no others grunting or yelling with me by then now its too late faber closed the bible wellsuppose you tell me why you came here nobody listens any more i cant talk to the walls because theyre yelling at me i cant talk to my wife she listens to the walls i just want someone to hear what i have to say and maybe if i talk long enough itll make sense and i want you to teach me to understand what i read faber examined montags thin bluejowled face how did you get shaken up what knocked the torch out of your hands i dont know we have everything we need to be happy but we arent happy somethings missing i looked around the only thing i positively knew was gone was the books id burned in ten or twelve years so i thought books might help youre a hopeless romantic said faber it would be funny if it were not serious its not books you need its some of the things that once were in books the same things could be in the parlor families today the same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors but are not no no its not books at all youre looking for take it where you can find it in old phonograph records old motion pictures and in old friends look for it in nature and look for it in yourself books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget there is nothing magical in them at all the magic is only in what books say how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us of course you couldnt know this of course you still cant understand what i mean when i say all this you are intuitively right thats what counts three things are missing number one do you know why books such as this are so important because they have quality and what does the word quality mean to me it means texture this book has pores it has features this book can go under the microscope youd find life under the glass streaming past in infinite profusion the more pores the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper the more literary you are thats my definition anyway telling detail fresh detail the good writers touch life often the mediocre ones run a quick hand over her the bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies so now do you see why books are hated and feared they show the pores in the face of life the comfortable people want only wax moon faces poreless hairless expressionless we are living in a time when flowers are trying to live on flowers instead of growing on good rain and black loam even fireworks for all their prettiness come from the chemistry of the earth yet somehow we think we can grow feeding on flowers and fireworks without completing the cycle back to reality do you know the legend of hercules and antaeus the giant wrestler whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth but when he was held rootless in midair by hercules he perished easily if there isnt something in that legend for us today in this city in our time then i am completely insane well there we have the first thing i said we needed quality texture of information and the second leisure oh but weve plenty of offhours offhours yes but time to think if youre not driving a hundred miles an hour at a clip where you cant think of anything else but the danger then youre playing some game or sitting in some room where you cant argue with the fourwall televisor why the televisor is real it is immediate it has dimension it tells you what to think and blasts it in it must be right it seems so right it rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasnt time to protest what nonsense only the family is people i beg your pardon my wife says books arent real thank god for that you can shut them say hold on a moment you play god to it but who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a tv parlor it grows you any shape it wishes it is an environment as real as the world it becomes and is the truth books can be beaten down with reason but with all my knowledge and skepticism i have never been able to argue with a onehundredpiece symphony orchestra full color three dimensions and i being in and part of those incredible parlors as you see my parlor is nothing but four plaster walls and here he held out two small rubber plugs for my ears when i ride the subwayjets denhams dentifrice they toil not neither do they spin said montag eyes shut where do we go from here would books help us only if the third necessary thing could be given us number one as i said quality of information number two leisure to digest it and number three the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two and i hardly think a very old man and a fireman turned sour could do much this late in the game i can get books youre running a risk thats the good part of dying when youve nothing to lose you run any risk you want there youve said an interesting thing laughed faber without having read it are things like that in books but it came off the top of my mind all the better you didnt fancy it up for me or anyone even yourself montag leaned forward this afternoon i thought that if it turned out that books were worth while we might get a press and print some extra copies we you and i oh no faber sat up but let me tell you my plan if you insist on telling me i must ask you to leave but arent you interested not if you start talking the sort of talk that might get me burnt for my trouble the only way i could possibly listen to you would be if somehow the fireman structure itself could be burnt now if you suggest that we print extra books and arrange to have them hidden in firemens houses all over the country so that seeds of suspicion would be sown among these arsonists bravo id say plant the books turn in an alarm and see the firemens houses bum is that what you mean faber raised his brows and looked at montag as if he were seeing a new man i was joking if you thought it would be a plan worth trying id have to take your word it would help you cant guarantee things like that after all when we had all the books we needed we still insisted on finding the highest cliff to jump off but we do need a breather we do need knowledge and perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off the books are to remind us what asses and fools we are theyre caesars praetorian guard whispering as the parade roars down the avenue remember caesar thou art mortal most of us cant rush around talking to everyone know all the cities of the world we havent time money or that many friends the things youre looking for montag are in the world but the only way the average chap will ever see ninetynine per cent of them is in a book dont ask for guarantees and dont look to be saved in any one thing person machine or library do your own bit of saving and if you drown at least die knowing you were headed for shore faber got up and began to pace the room well asked montag youre absolutely serious absolutely its an insidious plan if i do say so myself faber glanced nervously at his bedroom door to see the firehouses burn across the land destroyed as hotbeds of treason the salamander devours his tail ho god ive a list of firemens residences everywhere with some sort of underground cant trust people thats the dirty part you and i and who else will set the fires arent there professors like yourself former writers historians linguists dead or ancient the older the better theyll go unnoticed you know dozens admit it oh there are many actors alone who havent acted pirandello or shaw or shakespeare for years because their plays are too aware of the world we could use their anger and we could use the honest rage of those historians who havent written a line for forty years true we might form classes in thinking and reading yes but that would just nibble the edges the whole cultures shot through the skeleton needs melting and reshaping good god it isnt as simple as just picking up a book you laid down half a century ago remember the firemen are rarely necessary the public itself stopped reading of its own accord you firemen provide a circus now and then at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze but its a small sideshow indeed and hardly necessary to keep things in line so few want to be rebels any more and out of those few most like myself scare easily can you dance faster than the white clown shout louder than mr gimmick and the parlor families if you can youll win your way montag in any event youre a fool people are having fun committing suicide murdering a bomber flight had been moving east all the time they talked and only now did the two men stop and listen feeling the great jet sound tremble inside themselves patience montag let the war turn off the families our civilization is flinging itself to pieces stand back from the centrifuge there has to be someone ready when it blows up what men quoting milton saying i remember sophocles reminding the survivors that man has his good side too they will only gather up their stones to hurl at each other montag go home go to bed why waste your final hours racing about your cage denying youre a squirrel then you dont care any more i care so much im sick and you wont help me good night good night montags hands picked up the bible he saw what his hands had done and he looked surprised would you like to own this faber said id give my right arm montag stood there and waited for the next thing to happen his hands by themselves like two men working together began to rip the pages from the book the hands tore the flyleaf and then the first and then the second page idiot whatre you doing faber sprang up as if he had been struck he fell against montag montag warded him off and let his hands continue six more pages fell to the floor he picked them up and wadded the paper under fabers gaze dont oh dont said the old man who can stop me im a fireman i can bum you the old man stood looking at him you wouldnt i could the book dont tear it any more faber sank into a chair his face very white his mouth trembling dont make me feel any more tired what do you want i need you to teach me all right all right montag put the book down he began to unwad the crumpled paper and flatten it out as the old man watched tiredly faber shook his head as if he were waking up montag have you some money some four five hundred dollars why bring it i know a man who printed our college paper half a century ago that was the year i came to class at the start of the new semester and found only one student to sign up for drama from aeschylus to oneill you see how like a beautiful statue of ice it was melting in the sun i remember the newspapers dying like huge moths no one wanted them back no one missed them and the government seeing how advantageous it was to have people reading only about passionate lips and the fist in the stomach circled the situation with your fireeaters so montag theres this unemployed printer we might start a few books and wait on the war to break the pattern and give us the push we need a few bombs and the families in the walls of all the houses like harlequin rats will shut up in silence our stagewhisper might carry they both stood looking at the book on the table ive tried to remember said montag but hell its gone when i turn my head god how i want something to say to the captain hes read enough so he has all the answers or seems to have his voice is like butter im afraid hell talk me back the way i was only a week ago pumping a kerosene hose i thought god what fun the old man nodded those who dont build must burn its as old as history and juvenile delinquents so thats what i am theres some of it in all of us montag moved towards the front door can you help me in any way tonight with the fire captain i need an umbrella to keep off the rain im so damned afraid ill drown if he gets me again the old man said nothing but glanced once more nervously at his bedroom montag caught the glance well the old man took a deep breath held it and let it out he took another eyes closed his mouth tight and at last exhaled montag the old man turned at last and said come along i would actually have let you walk right out of my house i am a cowardly old fool faber opened the bedroom door and led montag into a small chamber where stood a table upon which a number of metal tools lay among a welter of microscopic wirehairs tiny coils bobbins and crystals whats this asked montag proof of my terrible cowardice ive lived alone so many years throwing images on walls with my imagination fiddling with electronics radiotransmission has been my hobby my cowardice is of such a passion complementing the revolutionary spirit that lives in its shadow i was forced to design this he picked up a small greenmetal object no larger than a bullet i paid for all thishow playing the stockmarket of course the last refuge in the world for the dangerous intellectual out of a job well i played the market and built all this and ive waited ive waited trembling half a lifetime for someone to speak to me i dared speak to no one that day in the park when we sat together i knew that some day you might drop by with fire or friendship it was hard to guess ive had this little item ready for months but i almost let you go im that afraid it looks like a seashell radio and something more it listens if you put it in your ear montag i can sit comfortably home warming my frightened bones and hear and analyse the firemens world find its weaknesses without danger im the queen bee safe in the hive you will be the drone the travelling ear eventually i could put out ears into all parts of the city with various men listening and evaluating if the drones die im still safe at home tending my fright with a maximum of comfort and a minimum of chance see how safe i play it how contemptible i am montag placed the green bullet in his ear the old man inserted a similar object in his own ear and moved his lips montag the voice was in montags head i hear you the old man laughed youre coming over fine too faber whispered but the voice in montags head was clear go to the firehouse when its time ill be with you lets listen to this captain beatty together he could be one of us god knows ill give you things to say well give him a good show do you hate me for this electronic cowardice of mine here i am sending you out into the night while i stay behind the lines with my damned ears listening for you to get your head chopped off we all do what we do said montag he put the bible in the old mans hands here ill chance turning in a substitute tomorrow ill see the unemployed printer yes that much i can do good night professor not good night ill be with you the rest of the night a vin egar gnat tickling your ear when you need me but good night and good luck anyway the door opened and shut montag was in the dark street again looking at the world you could feel the war getting ready in the sky that night the way the clouds moved aside and came back and the way the stars looked a million of them swimming between the clouds like the enemy discs and the feeling that the sky might fall upon the city and turn it to chalk dust and the moon go up in red fire that was how the night felt montag walked from the subway with the money in his pocket he had visited the bank which was open all night and every night with robot tellers in attendance and as he walked he was listening to the seashell radio in one car we have mobilized a million men quick victory is ours if the war comes music flooded over the voice quickly and it was gone ten million men mobilized fabers voice whispered in his other ear but say one million its happier faber yes im not thinking im just doing like im told like always you said get the money and i got it i didnt really think of it myself when do i start working things out on my own youve started already by saying what you just said youll have to take me on faith i took the others on faith yes and look where were headed youll have to travel blind for a while heres my arm to hold on to i dont want to change sides and just be told what to do theres no reason to change if i do that youre wise already montag felt his feet moving him on the sidewalk toward his house keep talking would you like me to read ill read so you can remember i go to bed only five hours a night nothing to do so if you like ill read you to sleep nights they say you retain knowledge even when youre sleeping if someone whispers it in your ear yes here far away across town in the night the faintest whisper of a turned page the book of job the moon rose in the sky as montag walked his lips moving just a trifle he was eating a light supper at nine in the evening when the front door cried out in the hall and mildred ran from the parlour like a native fleeing an eruption of vesuvius mrs phelps and mrs bowles came through the front door and vanished into the volcanos mouth with martinis in their hands montag stopped eating they were like a monstrous crystal chandelier tinkling in a thousand chimes he saw their cheshire cat smiles burning through the walls of the house and now they were screaming at each other above the din montag found himself at the parlour door with his food still in his mouth doesnt everyone look nice nice you look fine millie fine everyone looks swell swell montag stood watching them patience whispered faber i shouldnt be here whispered montag almost to himself i should be on my way back to you with the money tomorrows time enough careful isnt this show wonderful cried mildred wonderful on one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice simultaneously how does she do both at once thought montag insanely in the other walls an xray of the same woman revealed the contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her delightful stomach abruptly the room took off on a rocket flight into the clouds it plunged into a limegreen sea where blue fish ate red and yellow fish a minute later three white cartoon clowns chopped off each others limbs to the accompaniment of immense incoming tides of laughter two minutes more and the room whipped out of town to the jet cars wildly circling an arena bashing and backing up and bashing each other again montag saw a number of bodies fly in the air millie did you see that i saw it i saw it montag reached inside the parlour wall and pulled the main switch the images drained away as if the water had been let out from a gigantic crystal bowl of hysterical fish the three women turned slowly and looked with unconcealed irritation and then dislike at montag when do you suppose the war will start he said i notice your husbands arent here tonight oh they come and go come and go said mrs phelps in again out again finnegan the army called pete yesterday hell be back next week the army said so quick war fortyeight hours they said and everyone home thats what the army said quick war pete was called yesterday and they said hed be back next week quick the three women fidgeted and looked nervously at the empty mudcoloured walls im not worried said mrs phelps ill let pete do all the worrying she giggled ill let old pete do all the worrying not me im not worried its always someone elses husband dies they say ive heard that too ive never known any dead man killed in a war killed jumping off buildings yes like glorias husband last week but from wars no not from wars said mrs phelps anyway pete and i always said no tears nothing like that its our third marriage each and were independent be independent we always said he said if i get killed off you just go right ahead and dont cry but get married again and dont think of me that reminds me said mildred did you see that clara dove fiveminute romance last night in your wall well it was all about this woman who montag said nothing but stood looking at the womens faces as he had once looked at the faces of saints in a strange church he had entered when he was a child the faces of those enameled creatures meant nothing to him though he talked to them and stood in that church for a long time trying to be of that religion trying to know what that religion was trying to get enough of the raw incense and special dust of the place into his lungs and thus into his blood to feel touched and concerned by the meaning of the colorful men and women with the porcelain eyes and the bloodruby lips but there was nothing nothing it was a stroll through another store and his currency strange and unusable there and his passion cold even when he touched the wood and plaster and clay so it was now in his own parlor with these women twisting in their chairs under his gaze lighting cigarettes blowing smoke touching their sunfired hair and examining their blazing fingernails as if they had caught fire from his look their faces grew haunted with silence they leaned forward at the sound of montags swallowing his final bite of food they listened to his feverish breathing the three empty walls of the room were like the pale brows of sleeping giants now empty of dreams montag felt that if you touched these three staring brows you would feel a fine salt sweat on your fingertips the perspiration gathered with the silence and the subaudible trembling around and about and in the women who were burning with tension any moment they might hiss a long sputtering hiss and explode montag moved his lips lets talk the women jerked and stared howre your children mrs phelps he asked you know i havent any no one in his right mind the good lord knows would have children said mrs phelps not quite sure why she was angry with this man i wouldnt say that said mrs bowles ive had two children by caesarian section no use going through all that agony for a baby the world must reproduce you know the race must go on besides they sometimes look just like you and thats nice two caesarians tamed the trick yes sir oh my doctor said caesarians arent necessary youve got the hips for it everythings normal but i insisted caesarians or not children are ruinous youre out of your mind said mrs phelps i plunk the children in school nine days out of ten i put up with them when they come home three days a month its not bad at all you heave them into the parlor and turn the switch its like washing clothes stuff laundry in and slam the lid mrs bowles tittered theyd just as soon kick as kiss me thank god i can kick back the women showed their tongues laughing mildred sat a moment and then seeing that montag was still in the doorway clapped her hands lets talk politics to please guy sounds fine said mrs bowles i voted last election same as everyone and i laid it on the line for president noble i think hes one of the nicestlooking men who ever became president oh but the man they ran against him he wasnt much was he kind of small and homely and he didnt shave too close or comb his hair very well what possessed the outs to run him you just dont go running a little short man like that against a tall man besides he mumbled half the time i couldnt hear a word he said and the words i did hear i didnt understand fat too and didnt dress to hide it no wonder the landslide was for winston noble even their names helped compare winston noble to hubert hoag for ten seconds and you can almost figure the results damn it cried montag what do you know about hoag and noble why they were right in that parlor wall not six months ago one was always picking his nose it drove me wild well mr montag said mrs phelps do you want us to vote for a man like that mildred beamed you just run away from the door guy and dont make us nervous but montag was gone and back in a moment with a book in his hand guy damn it all damn it all damn it whatve you got there isnt that a book i thought that all special training these days was done by film mrs phelps blinked you reading up on fireman theory theory hell said montag its poetry montag a whisper leave me alone montag felt himself turning in a great circling roar and buzz and hum montag hold on dont did you hear them did you hear these monsters talking about monsters oh god the way they jabber about people and their own children and themselves and the way they talk about their husbands and the way they talk about war dammit i stand here and i cant believe it i didnt say a single word about any war ill have you know said mrs phelps as for poetry i hate it said mrs bowles have you ever read any montag fabers voice scraped away at him youll ruin everything shut up you fool all three women were on their feet sit down they sat im going home quavered mrs bowles montag montag please in the name of god what are you up to pleaded faber why dont you just read us one of those poems from your little book mrs phelps nodded i think thatd he very interesting thats not right wailed mrs bowles we cant do that well look at mr montag he wants to i know he does and if we listen nice mr montag will be happy and then maybe we can go on and do something else she glanced nervously at the long emptiness of the walls enclosing them montag go through with this and ill cut off ill leave the beetle jabbed his ear what good is this whatll you prove scare hell out of them thats what scare the living daylights out mildred looked at the empty air now guy just who are you talking to a silver needle pierced his brain montag listen only one way out play it as a joke cover up pretend you arent mad at all thenwalk to your wallincinerator and throw the book in mildred had already anticipated this in a quavery voice ladies once a year every firemans allowed to bring one book home from the old days to show his family how silly it all was how nervous that sort of thing can make you how crazy guys surprise tonight is to read you one sample to show how mixedup things were so none of us will ever have to bother our little old heads about that junk again isnt that right darling he crushed the book in his fists say yes his mouth moved like fabers yes mildred snatched the book with a laugh here read this one no i take it back heres that real funny one you read out loud today ladies you wont understand a word it goes umptytumptyump go ahead guy that page dear he looked at the opened page a fly stirred its wings softly in his ear read whats the title dear dover beach his mouth was numb now read in a nice clear voice and go slow the room was blazing hot he was all fire he was all coldness they sat in the middle of an empty desert with three chairs and him standing swaying and him waiting for mrs phelps to stop straightening her dress hem and mrs bowles to take her fingers away from her hair then he began to read in a low stumbling voice that grew firmer as he progressed from line to line and his voice went out across the desert into the whiteness and around the three sitting women there in the great hot emptiness the sea of faith was once too at the full and round earths shore lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled but now i only hear its melancholy long withdrawing roar retreating to the breath of the nightwind down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of the world the chairs creaked under the three women montag finished it out ah love let us be true to one another for the world which seems to lie before us like a land of dreams so various so beautiful so new hath really neither joy nor love nor light nor certitude nor peace nor help for pain and we are here as on a darkling plain swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night mrs phelps was crying the others in the middle of the desert watched her crying grow very loud as her face squeezed itself out of shape they sat not touching her bewildered by her display she sobbed uncontrollably montag himself was stunned and shaken sh sh said mildred youre all right clara now clara snap out of it clara whats wrong ii sobbed mrs phelps dont know dont know i just dont know oh oh mrs bowles stood up and glared at montag you see i knew it thats what i wanted to prove i knew it would happen ive always said poetry and tears poetry and suicide and crying and awful feelings poetry and sickness all that mush now ive had it proved to me youre nasty mr montag youre nasty faber said now montag felt himself turn and walk to the wallslot and drop the book in through the brass notch to the waiting flames silly words silly words silly awful hurting words said mrs bowles why do people want to hurt people not enough hurt in the world youve got to tease people with stuff like that clara now clara begged mildred pulling her arm come on lets be cheery you turn the family on now go ahead lets laugh and be happy now stop crying well have a party no said mrs bowles im trotting right straight home you want to visit my house and family well and good but i wont come in this firemans crazy house again in my lifetime go home montag fixed his eyes upon her quietly go home and think of your first husband divorced and your second husband killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out go home and think of the dozen abortions youve had go home and think of that and your damn caesarian sections too and your children who hate your guts go home and think how it all happened and what did you ever do to stop it go home go home he yelled before i knock you down and kick you out of the door doors slammed and the house was empty montag stood alone in the winter weather with the parlour walls the colour of dirty snow in the bathroom water ran he heard mildred shake the sleeping tablets into her hand fool montag fool fool oh god you silly fool shut up he pulled the green bullet from his ear and jammed it into his pocket it sizzled faintly fool fool he searched the house and found the books where mildred had stacked them behind the refrigerator some were missing and he knew that she had started on her own slow process of dispersing the dynamite in her house stick by stick but he was not angry now only exhausted and bewildered with himself he carried the books into the backyard and hid them in the bushes near the alley fence for tonight only he thought in case she decides to do any more burning he went back through the house mildred he called at the door of the darkened bedroom there was no sound outside crossing the lawn on his way to work he tried not to see how completely dark and deserted clarisse mcclellans house was on the way downtown he was so completely alone with his terrible error that he felt the necessity for the strange warmness and goodness that came from a familiar and gentle voice speaking in the night already in a few short hours it seemed that he had known faber a lifetime now he knew that he was two people that he was above all montag who knew nothing who did not even know himself a fool but only suspected it and he knew that he was also the old man who talked to him and talked to him as the train was sucked from one end of the night city to the other on one long sickening gasp of motion in the days to follow and in the nights when there was no moon and in the nights when there was a very bright moon shining on the earth the old man would go on with this talking and this talking drop by drop stone by stone flake by flake his mind would well over at last and he would not be montag any more this the old man told him assured him promised him he would be montagplusfaber fire plus water and then one day after everything had mixed and simmered and worked away in silence there would be neither fire nor water but wine out of two separate and opposite things a third and one day he would look back upon the fool and know the fool even now he could feel the start of the long journey the leavetaking the going away from the self he had been it was good listening to the beetle hum the sleepy mosquito buzz and delicate filigree murmur of the old mans voice at first scolding him and then consoling him in the late hour of night as he emerged from the steaming subway toward the firehouse world pity montag pity dont haggle and nag them you were so recently of them yourself they are so confident that they will run on for ever but they wont run on they dont know that this is all one huge big blazing meteor that makes a pretty fire in space but that some day itll have to hit they see only the blaze the pretty fire as you saw it montag old men who stay at home afraid tending their peanutbrittle bones have no right to criticize yet you almost killed things at the start watch it im with you remember that i understand how it happened i must admit that your blind raging invigorated me god how young i felt but nowi want you to feel old i want a little of my cowardice to be distilled in you tonight the next few hours when you see captain beatty tiptoe round him let me hear him for you let me feel the situation out survival is our ticket forget the poor silly women i made them unhappier than they have been in years i think said montag it shocked me to see mrs phelps cry maybe theyre right maybe its best not to face things to run have fun i dont know i feel guilty no you mustnt if there were no war if there was peace in the world id say fine have fun but montag you mustnt go back to being just a fireman all isnt well with the world montag perspired montag you listening my feet said montag i cant move them i feel so damn silly my feet wont move listen easy now said the old man gently i know i know youre afraid of making mistakes dont be mistakes can be profited by man when i was young i shoved my ignorance in peoples faces they beat me with sticks by the time i was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me if you hide your ignorance no one will hit you and youll never learn now pick up your feet into the firehouse with you were twins were not alone any more were not separated out in different parlors with no contact between if you need help when beatty pries at you ill be sitting right here in your eardrum making notes montag felt his right foot then his left foot move old man he said stay with me the mechanical hound was gone its kennel was empty and the firehouse stood all about in plaster silence and the orange salamander slept with its kerosene in its belly and the fire throwers crossed upon its flanks and montag came in through the silence and touched the brass pole and slid up in the dark air looking back at the deserted kennel his heart beating pausing beating faber was a grey moth asleep in his ear for the moment beatty stood near the drophole waiting but with his back turned as if he were not waiting well he said to the men playing cards here comes a very strange beast which in all tongues is called a fool he put his hand to one side palm up for a gift montag put the book in it without even glancing at the title beatty tossed the book into the trashbasket and lit a cigarette who are a little wise the best fools be welcome back montag i hope youll be staying with us now that your fever is done and your sickness over sit in for a hand of poker they sat and the cards were dealt in beattys sight montag felt the guilt of his hands his fingers were like ferrets that had done some evil and now never rested always stirred and picked and hid in pockets moving from under beattys alcoholflame stare if beatty so much as breathed on them montag felt that his hands might wither turn over on their sides and never be shocked to life again they would be buried the rest of his life in his coatsleeves forgotten for these were the hands that had acted on their own no part of him here was where the con science first manifested itself to snatch books dart off with job and ruth and willie shakespeare and now in the firehouse these hands seemed gloved with blood twice in half an hour montag had to rise from the game and go to the latrine to wash his hands when he came back he hid his hands under the table beatty laughed lets have your hands in sight montag not that we dont trust you understand but they all laughed well said beatty the crisis is past and all is well the sheep returns to the fold were all sheep who have strayed at times truth is truth to the end of reckoning weve cried they are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts weve shouted to ourselves sweet food of sweetly uttered knowledge sir philip sidney said but on the other hand words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found alexander pope what do you think of that i dont know careful whispered faber living in another world far away or this a little learning is a dangerous thing drink deep or taste not the pierian spring there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain and drinking largely sobers us again pope same essay where does that put you montag bit his lip ill tell you said beatty smiling at his cards that made you for a little while a drunkard read a few lines and off you go over the cliff bang youre ready to blow up the world chop off heads knock down women and children destroy authority i know ive been through it all im all right said montag nervously stop blushing im not needling really im not do you know i had a dream an hour ago i lay down for a catnap and in this dream you and i montag got into a furious debate on books you towered with rage yelled quotes at me i calmly parried every thrust power i said and you quoting dr johnson said knowledge is more than equivalent to force and i said well dr johnson also said dear boy that he is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty stick with the fireman montag all else is dreary chaos dont listen whispered faber hes trying to confuse hes slippery watch out beatty chuckled and you said quoting truth will come to light murder will not be hid long and i cried in good humour oh god he speaks only of his horse and the devil can cite scripture for his purpose and you yelled this age thinks better of a gilded fool than of a threadbare saint in wisdoms school and i whispered gently the dignity of truth is lost with much protesting and you screamed carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer and i said patting your hand what do i give you trench mouth and you shrieked knowledge is power and a dwarf on a giants shoulders of the furthest of the two and i summed my side up with rare serenity in the folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths and oneself as an oracle is inborn in us mr valery once said montags head whirled sickeningly he felt beaten unmercifully on brow eyes nose lips chin on shoulders on upflailing arms he wanted to yell no shut up youre confusing things stop it beattys graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist god what a pulse ive got you going have i montag jesus god your pulse sounds like the day after the war every thing but sirens and bells shall i talk some more i like your look of panic swahili indian english lit i speak them all a kind of excellent dumb discourse willie montag hold on the moth brushed montags ear hes muddying the waters oh you were scared silly said beatty for i was doing a terrible thing in using the very books you clung to to rebut you on every hand on every point what traitors books can be you think theyre backing you up and they turn on you others can use them too and there you are lost in the middle of the moor in a great welter of nouns and verbs and adjectives and at the very end of my dream along i came with the salamander and said going my way and you got in and we drove back to the firehouse in beatific silence all dwindled away to peace beatty let montags wrist go let the hand slump limply on the table alls well that is well in the end silence montag sat like a carved white stone the echo of the final hammer on his skull died slowly away into the black cavern where faber waited for the echoes to subside and then when the startled dust had settled down about montags mind faber began softly all right hes had his say you must take it in ill say my say too in the next few hours and youll take it in and youll try to judge them and make your decision as to which way to jump or fall but i want it to be your decision not mine and not the captains but remember that the captain belongs to the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom the solid unmoving cattle of the majority oh god the terrible tyranny of the majority we all have our harps to play and its up to you now to know with which ear youll listen montag opened his mouth to answer faber and was saved this error in the presence of others when the station bell rang the alarmvoice in the ceiling chanted there was a tackingtacking sound as the alarmreport telephone typed out the address across the room captain beatty his poker cards in one pink hand walked with exaggerated slowness to the phone and ripped out the address when the report was finished he glanced perfunctorily at it and shoved it in his pocket he came back and sat down the others looked at him it can wait exactly forty seconds while i take all the money away from you said beatty happily montag put his cards down tired montag going out of this game yes hold on well come to think of it we can finish this hand later just leave your cards face down and hustle the equipment on the double now and beatty rose up again montag you dont look well id hate to think you were coming down with another fever ill be all right youll be fine this is a special case come on jump for it they leaped into the air and clutched the brass pole as if it were the last vantage point above a tidal wave passing below and then the brass pole to their dismay slid them down into darkness into the blast and cough and suction of the gaseous dragon roaring to life hey they rounded a corner in thunder and siren with concussion of tyres with scream of rubber with a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery brass tank like the food in the stomach of a giant with montags fingers jolting off the silver rail swinging into cold space with the wind tearing his hair back from his head with the wind whistling in his teeth and him all the while thinking of the women the chaff women in his parlor tonight with the kernels blown out from under them by a neon wind and his silly damned reading of a book to them how like trying to put out fires with waterpistols how senseless and insane one rage turned in for another one anger displacing another when would he stop being entirely mad and be quiet be very quiet indeed here we go montag looked up beatty never drove but he was driving tonight slamming the salamander around corners leaning forward high on the drivers throne his massive black slicker flapping out behind so that he seemed a great black bat flying above the engine over the brass numbers taking the full wind here we go to keep the world happy montag beattys pink phosphorescent cheeks glimmered in the high darkness and he was smiling furiously here we are the salamander boomed to a halt throwing men off in slips and clumsy hops montag stood fixing his raw eyes to the cold bright rail under his clenched fingers i cant do it he thought how can i go at this new assignment how can i go on burning things i cant go in this place beatty smelling of the wind through which he had rushed was at montags elbow all right montag the men ran like cripples in their clumsy boots as quietly as spiders at last montag raised his eyes and turned beatty was watching his face something the matter montag why said montag slowly weve stopped in front of my house burning bright lights flicked on and housedoors opened all down the street to watch the carnival set up montag and beatty stared one with dry satisfaction the other with disbelief at the house before them this main ring in which torches would be juggled and fire eaten well said beatty now you did it old montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that hes burnt his damn wings he wonders why didnt i hint enough when i sent the hound around your place montags face was entirely numb and featureless he felt his head turn like a stone carving to the dark place next door set in its bright borders of flowers beatty snorted oh no you werent fooled by that little idiots routine now were you flowers butterflies leaves sunsets oh hell its all in her file ill be damned ive hit the bullseye look at the sick look on your face a few grassblades and the quarters of the moon what trash what good did she ever do with all that montag sat on the cold fender of the dragon moving his head half an inch to the left half an inch to the right left right left right left she saw everything she didnt do anything to anyone she just let them alone alone hell she chewed around you didnt she one of those damn dogooders with their shocked holierthanthou silences their one talent making others feel guilty god damn they rise like the midnight sun to sweat you in your bed the front door opened mildred came down the steps running one suitcase held with a dreamlike clenching rigidity in her fist as a beetletaxi hissed to the curb mildred she ran past with her body stiff her face floured with powder her mouth gone without lipstick mildred you didnt put in the alarm she shoved the valise in the waiting beetle climbed in and sat mumbling poor family poor family oh everything gone everything everything gone now beatty grabbed montags shoulder as the beetle blasted away and hit seventy miles an hour far down the street gone there was a crash like the falling parts of a dream fashioned out of warped glass mirrors and crystal prisms montag drifted about as if still another incomprehensible storm had turned him to see stoneman and black wielding axes shattering windowpanes to provide crossventilation the brush of a deathshead moth against a cold black screen montag this is faber do you hear me what is happening this is happening to me said montag what a dreadful surprise said beatty for everyone nowadays knows absolutely is certain that nothing will ever happen to me others die i go on there are no consequences and no responsibilities except that there are but lets not talk about them eh by the time the consequences catch up with you its too late isnt it montag montag can you get away run asked faber montag walked but did not feel his feet touch the cement and then the night grasses beatty flicked his igniter nearby and the small orange flame drew his fascinated gaze what is there about fire thats so lovely no matter what age we are what draws us to it beatty blew out the flame and lit it again its perpetual motion the thing man wanted to invent but never did or almost perpetual motion if you let it go on itd burn our lifetimes out what is fire its a mystery scientists give us gobbledegook about friction and molecules but they dont really know its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences a problem gets too burdensome then into the furnace with it now montag youre a burden and fire will lift you off my shoulders clean quick sure nothing to rot later antibiotic aesthetic practical montag stood looking in now at this queer house made strange by the hour of the night by murmuring neighbour voices by littered glass and there on the floor their covers torn off and spilled out like swanfeathers the incredible books that looked so silly and really not worth bothering with for these were nothing but black type and yellowed paper and raveled binding mildred of course she must have watched him hide the books in the garden and brought them back in mildred mildred i want you to do this job all by your lonesome montag not with kerosene and a match but piecework with a flamethrower your house your cleanup montag cant you run get away no cried montag helplessly the hound because of the hound faber heard and beatty thinking it was meant for him heard yes the hounds somewhere about the neighborhood so dont try anything ready ready montag snapped the safetycatch on the flamethrower fire a great nuzzling gout of flame leapt out to lap at the books and knock them against the wall he stepped into the bedroom and fired twice and the twin beds went up in a great simmering whisper with more heat and passion and light than he would have supposed them to contain he burnt the bedroom walls and the cosmetics chest because he wanted to change everything the chairs the tables and in the diningroom the silverware and plastic dishes everything that showed that he had lived here in this empty house with a strange woman who would forget him tomorrow who had gone and quite forgotten him already listening to her seashell radio pour in on her and in on her as she rode across town alone and as before it was good to burn he felt himself gush out in the fire snatch rend rip in half with flame and put away the senseless problem if there was no solution well then now there was no problem either fire was best for everything the books montag the books leapt and danced like roasted birds their wings ablaze with red and yellow feathers and then he came to the parlor where the great idiot monsters lay asleep with their white thoughts and their snowy dreams and he shot a bolt at each of the three blank walls and the vacuum hissed out at him the emptiness made an even emptier whistle a senseless scream he tried to think about the vacuum upon which the nothingness had performed but he could not he held his breath so the vacuum could not get into his lungs he cut off its terrible emptiness drew back and gave the entire room a gift of one huge bright yellow flower of burning the fireproof plastic sheath on everything was cut wide and the house began to shudder with flame when youre quite finished said beatty behind him youre under arrest the house fell in red coals and black ash it bedded itself down in sleepy pinkgrey cinders and a smoke plume blew over it rising and waving slowly back and forth in the sky it was threethirty in the morning the crowd drew back into the houses the great tents of the circus had slumped into charcoal and rubble and the show was well over montag stood with the flamethrower in his limp hands great islands of perspiration drenching his armpits his face smeared with soot the other firemen waited behind him in the darkness their faces illuminated faintly by the smoldering foundation montag started to speak twice and then finally managed to put his thought together was it my wife turned in the alarm beatty nodded but her friends turned in an alarm earlier that i let ride one way or the other youd have got it it was pretty silly quoting poetry around free and easy like that it was the act of a silly damn snob give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks hes the lord of all creation you think you can walk on water with your books well the world can get by just fine without them look where they got you in slime up to your lip if i stir the slime with my little finger youll drown montag could not move a great earthquake had come with fire and leveled the house and mildred was under there somewhere and his entire life under there and he could not move the earthquake was still shaking and falling and shivering inside him and he stood there his knees halfbent under the great load of tiredness and bewilderment and outrage letting beatty hit him without raising a hand montag you idiot montag you damn fool why did you really do it montag did not hear he was far away he was running with his mind he was gone leaving this dead sootcovered body to sway in front of another raving fool montag get out of there said faber montag listened beatty struck him a blow on the head that sent him reeling back the green bullet in which fabers voice whispered and cried fell to the sidewalk beatty snatched it up grinning he held it half in half out of his ear montag heard the distant voice calling montag you all right beatty switched the green bullet off and thrust it in his pocket wellso theres more here than i thought i saw you tilt your head listening first i thought you had a seashell but when you turned clever later i wondered well trace this and drop it on your friend no said montag he twitched the safety catch on the flamethrower beatty glanced instantly at montags fingers and his eyes widened the faintest bit montag saw the surprise there and himself glanced to his hands to see what new thing they had done thinking back later he could never decide whether the hands or beattys reaction to the hands gave him the final push toward murder the last rolling thunder of the avalanche stoned down about his ears not touching him beatty grinned his most charming grin well thats one way to get an audience hold a gun on a man and force him to listen to your speech speech away whatll it be this time why dont you belch shakespeare at me you fumbling snob there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as an idle wind which i respect not hows that go ahead now you secondhand litterateur pull the trigger he took one step toward montag montag only said we never burned right hand it over guy said beatty with a fixed smile and then he was a shrieking blaze a jumping sprawling gibbering mannikin no longer human or known all writhing flame on the lawn as montag shot one continuous pulse of liquid fire on him there was a hiss like a great mouthful of spittle banging a redhot stove a bubbling and frothing as if salt had been poured over a monstrous black snail to cause a terrible liquefaction and a boiling over of yellow foam montag shut his eyes shouted shouted and fought to get his hands at his ears to clamp and to cut away the sound beatty flopped over and over and over and at last twisted in on himself like a charred wax doll and lay silent the other two firemen did not move montag kept his sickness down long enough to aim the flamethrower turn around they turned their faces like blanched meat streaming sweat he beat their heads knocking off their helmets and bringing them down on themselves they fell and lay without moving the blowing of a single autumn leaf he turned and the mechanical hound was there it was half across the lawn coming from the shadows moving with such drifting ease that it was like a single solid cloud of blackgrey smoke blown at him in silence it made a single last leap into the air coming down at montag from a good three feet over his head its spidered legs reaching the procaine needle snapping out its single angry tooth montag caught it with a bloom of fire a single wondrous blossom that curled in petals of yellow and blue and orange about the metal dog clad it in a new covering as it slammed into montag and threw him ten feet back against the bole of a tree taking the flamegun with him he felt it scrabble and seize his leg and stab the needle in for a moment before the fire snapped the hound up in the air burst its metal bones at the joints and blew out its interior in the single flushing of red colour like a skyrocket fastened to the street montag lay watching the deadalive thing fiddle the air and die even now it seemed to want to get back at him and finish the injection which was now working through the flesh of his leg he felt all of the mingled relief and horror at having pulled back only in time to have just his knee slammed by the fender of a car hurtling by at ninety miles an hour he was afraid to get up afraid he might not be able to gain his feet at all with an anaesthetized leg a numbness in a numbness hollowed into a numbness and now the street empty the house burnt like an ancient bit of stagescenery the other homes dark the hound here beatty there the three other firemen another place and the salamander he gazed at the immense engine that would have to go too well he thought lets see how badly off you are on your feet now easy easy there he stood and he had only one leg the other was like a chunk of burnt pinelog he was carrying along as a penance for some obscure sin when he put his weight on it a shower of silver needles gushed up the length of the calf and went off in the knee he wept come on come on you you cant stay here a few houselights were going on again down the street whether from the incidents just passed or because of the abnormal silence following the fight montag did not know he hobbled around the ruins seizing at his bad leg when it lagged talking and whimpering and shouting directions at it and cursing it and pleading with it to work for him now when it was vital he heard a number of people crying out in the darkness and shouting he reached the back yard and the alley beatty he thought youre not a problem now you always said dont face a problem bum it well now ive done both goodbye captain and he stumbled along the alley in the dark a shotgun blast went off in his leg every time he put it down and he thought youre a fool a damn fool an awful fool an idiot an awful idiot a damn idiot and a fool a damn fool look at the mess and wheres the mop look at the mess and what do you do pride damn it and temper and youve junked it all at the very start you vomit on everyone and on yourself but everything at once but everything one on top of another beatty the women mildred clarisse everything no excuse though no excuse a fool a damn fool go give yourself up no well save what we can well do what there is left to do if we have to burn lets take a few more with us here he remembered the books and turned back just on the off chance he found a few books where he had left them near the garden fence mildred god bless her had missed a few four books still lay hidden where he had put them voices were wailing in the night and flashbeams swirled about other salamanders were roaring their engines far away and police sirens were cutting their way across town with their sirens montag took the four remaining books and hopped jolted hopped his way down the alley and suddenly fell as if his head had been cut off and only his body lay there something inside had jerked him to a halt and flopped him down he lay where he had fallen and sobbed his legs folded his face pressed blindly to the gravel beatty wanted to die in the middle of the crying montag knew it for the truth beatty had wanted to die he had just stood there not really trying to save himself just stood there joking needling thought montag and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air how strange strange to want to die so much that you let a man walk around armed and then instead of shutting up and staying alive you go on yelling at people and making fun of them until you get them mad and then at a distance running feet montag sat up lets get out of here come on get up get up you just cant sit but he was still crying and that had to be finished it was going away now he hadnt wanted to kill anyone not even beatty his flesh gripped him and shrank as if it had been plunged in acid he gagged he saw beatty a torch not moving fluttering out on the grass he bit at his knuckles im sorry im sorry oh god sorry he tried to piece it all together to go back to the normal pattern of life a few short days ago before the sieve and the sand denhams dentifrice mothvoices fireflies the alarms and excursions too much for a few short days too much indeed for a lifetime feet ran in the far end of the alley get up he told himself damn it get up he said to the leg and stood the pains were spikes driven in the kneecap and then only darning needles and then only common ordinary safety pins and after he had dragged along fifty more hops and jumps filling his hand with slivers from the board fence the prickling was like someone blowing a spray of scalding water on that leg and the leg was at last his own leg again he had been afraid that running might break the loose ankle now sucking all the night into his open mouth and blowing it out pale with all the blackness left heavily inside himself he set out in a steady jogging pace he carried the books in his hands he thought of faber faber was back there in the steaming lump of tar that had no name or identity now he had burnt faber too he felt so suddenly shocked by this that he felt faber was really dead baked like a roach in that small green capsule shoved and lost in the pocket of a man who was now nothing but a frame skeleton strung with asphalt tendons you must remember burn them or theyll burn you he thought right now its as simple as that he searched his pockets the money was there and in his other pocket he found the usual seashell upon which the city was talking to itself in the cold black morning police alert wanted fugitive in city has committed murder and crimes against the state name guy montag occupation fireman last seen he ran steadily for six blocks in the alley and then the alley opened out on to a wide empty thoroughfare ten lanes wide it seemed like a boatless river frozen there in the raw light of the high white arclamps you could drown trying to cross it he felt it was too wide it was too open it was a vast stage without scenery inviting him to run across easily seen in the blazing illumination easily caught easily shot down the seashell hummed in his ear watch for a man running watch for the running man watch for a man alone on foot watch montag pulled back into the shadows directly ahead lay a gas station a great chunk of porcelain snow shining there and two silver beetles pulling in to fill up now he must be clean and presentable if he wished to walk not run stroll calmly across that wide boulevard it would give him an extra margin of safety if he washed up and combed his hair before he went on his way to get where yes he thought where am i running nowhere there was nowhere to go no friend to turn to really except faber and then he realized that he was indeed running toward fabers house instinctively but faber couldnt hide him it would be suicide even to try but he knew that he would go to see faber anyway for a few short minutes fabers would be the place where he might refuel his fast draining belief in his own ability to survive he just wanted to know that there was a man like faber in the world he wanted to see the man alive and not burned back there like a body shelled in another body and some of the money must be left with faber of course to be spent after montag ran on his way perhaps he could make the open country and live on or near the rivers and near the highways in the fields and hills a great whirling whisper made him look to the sky the police helicopters were rising so far away that it seemed someone had blown the grey head off a dry dandelion flower two dozen of them flurried wavering indecisive three miles off like butterflies puzzled by autumn and then they were plummeting down to land one by one here there softly kneading the streets where turned back to beetles they shrieked along the boulevards or as suddenly leapt back into the sir continuing their search and here was the gas station its attendants busy now with customers approaching from the rear montag entered the mens washroom through the aluminum wall he heard a radio voice saying war has been declared the gas was being pumped outside the men in the beetles were talking and the attendants were talking about the engines the gas the money owed montag stood trying to make himself feel the shock of the quiet statement from the radio but nothing would happen the war would have to wait for him to come to it in his personal file an hour two hours from now he washed his hands and face and towelled himself dry making little sound he came out of the washroom and shut the door carefully and walked into the darkness and at last stood again on the edge of the empty boulevard there it lay a game for him to win a vast bowling alley in the cool morning the boulevard was as clean as the surface of an arena two minutes before the appearance of certain unnamed victims and certain unknown killers the air over and above the vast concrete river trembled with the warmth of montags body alone it was incredible how he felt his temperature could cause the whole immediate world to vibrate he was a phosphorescent target he knew it he felt it and now he must begin his little walk three blocks away a few headlights glared montag drew a deep breath his lungs were like burning brooms in his chest his mouth was sucked dry from running his throat tasted of bloody iron and there was rusted steel in his feet what about those lights there once you started walking youd have to gauge how fast those beetles could make it down here well how far was it to the other curb it seemed like a hundred yards probably not a hundred but figure for that anyway figure that with him going very slowly at a nice stroll it might take as much as thirty seconds forty seconds to walk all the way the beetles once started they could leave three blocks behind them in about fifteen seconds so even if halfway across he started to run he put his right foot out and then his left foot and then his right he walked on the empty avenue even if the street were entirely empty of course you couldnt be sure of a safe crossing for a car could appear suddenly over the rise four blocks further on and be on and past you before you had taken a dozen breaths he decided not to count his steps he looked neither to left nor right the light from the overhead lamps seemed as bright and revealing as the midday sun and just as hot he listened to the sound of the car picking up speed two blocks away on his right its movable headlights jerked back and forth suddenly and caught at montag keep going montag faltered got a grip on the books and forced himself not to freeze instinctively he took a few quick running steps then talked out loud to himself and pulled up to stroll again he was now half across the street but the roar from the beetles engines whined higher as it put on speed the police of course they see me but slow now slow quiet dont turn dont look dont seem concerned walk thats it walls walk the beetle was rushing the beetle was roaring the beetle raised its speed the beetle was whining the beetle was in high thunder the beetle came skimming the beetle came in a single whistling trajectory fired from an invisible rifle it was up to mph it was up to at least montag clamped his jaws the heat of the racing headlights burnt his cheeks it seemed and jittered his eyelids and flushed the sour sweat out all over his body he began to shuffle idiotically and talk to himself and then he broke and just ran he put out his legs as far as they would go and down and then far out again and down and back and out and down and back god god he dropped a book broke pace almost turned changed his mind plunged on yelling in concrete emptiness the beetle scuttling after its running food two hundred one hundred feet away ninety eighty seventy montag gasping flailing his hands legs up down out up down out closer closer hooting calling his eyes burnt white now as his head jerked about to confront the flashing glare now the beetle was swallowed in its own light now it was nothing but a torch hurtling upon him all sound all blare nowalmost on top of him he stumbled and fell im done its over but the falling made a difference an instant before reaching him the wild beetle cut and swerved out it was gone montag lay flat his head down wisps of laughter trailed back to him with the blue exhaust from the beetle his right hand was extended above him flat across the extreme tip of his middle finger he saw now as he lifted that hand a faint sixteenth of an inch of black tread where tire had touched in passing he looked at that black line with disbelief getting to his feet that wasnt the police he thought he looked down the boulevard it was clear now a carful of children all ages god knew from twelve to sixteen out whistling yelling hurrahing had seen a man a very extraordinary sight a man strolling a rarity and simply said lets get him not knowing he was the fugitive mr montag simply a number of children out for a long night of roaring five or six hundred miles in a few moonlit hours their faces icy with wind and coming home or not coming at dawn alive or not alive that made the adventure they would have killed me thought montag swaying the air still torn and stirring about him in dust touching his bruised cheek for no reason at all in the world they would have killed me he walked toward the far curb telling each foot to go and keep going somehow he had picked up the spilled books he didnt remember bending or touching them he kept moving them from hand to hand as if they were a poker hand he could not figure i wonder if they were the ones who killed clarisse he stopped and his mind said it again very loud i wonder if they were the ones who killed clarisse he wanted to run after them yelling his eyes watered the thing that had saved him was falling flat the driver of that car seeing montag down instinctively considered the probability that running over a body at that speed might turn the car upside down and spill them out if montag had remained an upright target montag gasped far down the boulevard four blocks away the beetle had slowed spun about on two wheels and was now racing back slanting over on the wrong side of the street picking up speed but montag was gone hidden in the safety of the dark alley for which he had set out on a long journey an hour or was it a minute ago he stood shivering in the night looking back out as the beetle ran by and skidded back to the centre of the avenue whirling laughter in the air all about it gone further on as montag moved in darkness he could see the helicopters falling falling like the first flakes of snow in the long winter to come the house was silent montag approached from the rear creeping through a thick nightmoistened scent of daffodils and roses and wet grass he touched the screen door in back found it open slipped in moved across the porch listening mrs black are you asleep in there he thought this isnt good but your husband did it to others and never asked and never wondered and never worried and now since youre a firemans wife its your house and your turn for all the houses your husband burned and the people he hurt without thinking the house did not reply he hid the books in the kitchen and moved from the house again to the alley and looked back and the house was still dark and quiet sleeping on his way across town with the helicopters fluttering like torn bits of paper in the sky he phoned the alarm at a lonely phone booth outside a store that was closed for the night then he stood in the cold night air waiting and at a distance he heard the fire sirens start up and run and the salamanders coming coming to bum mr blacks house while he was away at work to make his wife stand shivering in the morning air while the roof let go and dropped in upon the fire but now she was still asleep good night mrs black he thought faber another rap a whisper and a long waiting then after a minute a small light flickered inside fabers small house after another pause the back door opened they stood looking at each other in the halflight faber and montag as if each did not believe in the others existence then faber moved and put out his hand and grabbed montag and moved him in and sat him down and went back and stood in the door listening the sirens were wailing off in the morning distance he came in and shut the door montag said ive been a fool all down the line i cant stay long im on my way god knows where at least you were a fool about the right things said faber i thought you were dead the audiocapsule i gave you burnt i heard the captain talking to you and suddenly there was nothing i almost came out looking for you the captains dead he found the audiocapsule he heard your voice he was going to trace it i killed him with the flamethrower faber sat down and did not speak for a time my god how did this happen said montag it was only the other night everything was fine and the next thing i know im drowning how many times can a man go down and still be alive i cant breathe theres beatty dead and he was my friend once and theres millie gone i thought she was my wife but now i dont know and the house all burnt and my job gone and myself on the run and i planted a book in a firemans house on the way good christ the things ive done in a single week you did what you had to do it was coming on for a long time yes i believe that if theres nothing else i believe it saved itself up to happen i could feel it for a long time i was saving something up i went around doing one thing and feeling another god it was all there its a wonder it didnt show on me like fat and now here i am messing up your life they might follow me here i feel alive for the first time in years said faber i feel im doing what i should have done a lifetime ago for a little while im not afraid maybe its because im doing the right thing at last maybe its because ive done a rash thing and dont want to look the coward to you i suppose ill have to do even more violent things exposing myself so i wont fall down on the job and turn scared again what are your plans to keep running you know the wars on i heard god isnt it funny said the old man it seems so remote because we have our own troubles i havent had time to think montag drew out a hundred dollars i want this to stay with you use it any way thatll help when im gone but i might be dead by noon use this faber nodded youd better head for the river if you can follow along it and if you can hit the old railroad lines going out into the country follow them even though practically everythings airborne these days and most of the tracks are abandoned the rails are still there rusting ive heard there are still hobo camps all across the country here and there walking camps they call them and if you keep walking far enough and keep an eye peeled they say theres lots of old harvard degrees on the tracks between here and los angeles most of them are wanted and hunted in the cities they survive i guess there arent many of them and i guess the governments never considered them a great enough danger to go in and track them down you might hole up with them for a time and get in touch with me in st louis im leaving on the five am bus this morning to see a retired printer there im getting out into the open myself at last the money will be put to good use thanks and god bless you do you want to sleep a few minutes id better run lets check he took montag quickly into the bedroom and lifted a picture frame aside revealing a television screen the size of a postal card i always wanted something very small something i could talk to something i could blot out with the palm of my hand if necessary nothing that could shout me down nothing monstrous big so you see he snapped it on montag the tv set said and lit up montag the name was spelled out by the voice guy montag still running police helicopters are up a new mechanical hound has been brought from another district montag and faber looked at each other mechanical hound never fails never since its first use in tracking quarry has this incredible invention made a mistake tonight this network is proud to have the opportunity to fol low the hound by camera helicopter as it starts on its way to the target faber poured two glasses of whisky well need these they drank nose so sensitive the mechanical hound can remember and identify ten thousand odorindexes on ten thousand men without resetting faber trembled the least bit and looked about at his house at the walls the door the doorknob and the chair where montag now sat montag saw the look they both looked quickly about the house and montag felt his nostrils dilate and he knew that he was trying to track himself and his nose was suddenly good enough to sense the path he had made in the air of the room and the sweat of his hand hung from the doorknob invisible but as numerous as the jewels of a small chandelier he was everywhere in and on and about everything he was a luminous cloud a ghost that made breathing once more impossible he saw faber stop up his own breath for fear of drawing that ghost into his own body perhaps being contaminated with the phantom exhalations and odors of a running man the mechanical hound is now landing by helicopter at the site of the burning and there on the small screen was the burnt house and the crowd and something with a sheet over it and out of the sky fluttering came the helicopter like a grotesque flower so they must have their game out thought montag the circus must go on even with war beginning within the hour he watched the scene fascinated not wanting to move it seemed so remote and no part of him it was a play apart and separate wondrous to watch not without its strange pleasure thats all for me you thought thats all taking place just for me by god if he wished he could linger here in comfort and follow the entire hunt on through its swift phases down alleys across streets over empty running avenues crossing lots and playgrounds with pauses here or there for the necessary commercials up other alleys to the burning house of mr and mrs black and so on finally to this house with faber and himself seated drinking while the electric hound snuffed down the last trail silent as a drift of death itself skidded to a halt outside that window there then if he wished montag might rise walk to the window keep one eye on the tv screen open the window lean out look back and see himself dramatized described made over standing there limned in the bright small television screen from outside a drama to be watched objectively knowing that in other parlors he was large as life in full color dimensionally perfect and if he kept his eye peeled quickly he would see himself an instant before oblivion being punctured for the benefit of how many civilian parlorsitters who had been wakened from sleep a few minutes ago by the frantic sirening of their livingroom walls to come watch the big game the hunt the oneman carnival would he have time for a speech as the hound seized him in view of ten or twenty or thirty million people mightnt he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word that would stay with them long after the hound had turned clenching him in its metalplier jaws and trotted off in darkness while the camera remained stationary watching the creature dwindle in the distancea splendid fadeout what could he say in a single word a few words that would sear all their faces and wake them up there whispered faber out of a helicopter glided something that was not machine not animal not dead not alive glowing with a pale green luminosity it stood near the smoking ruins of montags house and the men brought his discarded flamethrower to it and put it down under the muzzle of the hound there was a whirring clicking humming montag shook his head and got up and drank the rest of his drink its time im sorry about this about what me my house i deserve everything run for gods sake perhaps i can delay them here wait theres no use your being discovered when i

bullet the right kind to put in your head go now one last thing quick a suitcase get it fill it with your dirtiest clothes an old suit the dirtier the better a shirt some old sneakers and socks faber was gone and back in a minute they sealed the cardboard valise with clear tape to keep the ancient odor of mr faber in of course said faber sweating at the job montag doused the exterior of the valise with whisky i dont want that hound picking up two odors at once may i take this whiskey ill need it later christ i hope this works they shook hands again and going out of the door they glanced at the tv the hound was on its way followed by hovering helicopter cameras silently silently sniffing the great night wind it was running down the first alley goodbye and montag was out the back door lightly running with the halfempty valise behind him he heard the lawnsprinkling system jump up filling the dark air with rain that fell gently and then with a steady pour all about washing on the sidewalks and draining into the alley he carried a few drops of this rain with him on his face he thought he heard the old man call goodbye but hewasnt certain he ran very fast away from the house down toward the river montag ran he could feel the hound like autumn come cold and dry and swift like a wind that didnt stir grass that didnt jar windows or disturb leafshadows on the white sidewalks as it passed the hound did not touch the world it carried its silence with it so you could feel the silence building up a pressure behind you all across town montag felt the pressure rising and ran he stopped for breath on his way to the river to peer through dimly lit windows of wakened houses and saw the silhouettes of people inside watching their parlor walls and there on the walls the mechanical hound a breath of neon vapor spidered along here and gone here and gone now at elm terrace lincoln oak park and up the alley toward fabers house go past thought montag dont stop go on dont turn in on the parlor wall fabers house with its sprinkler system pulsing in the night air the hound paused quivering no montag held to the window sill this way here the procaine needle flicked out and in out and in a single clear drop of the stuff of dreams fell from the needle as it vanished in the hounds muzzle montag held his breath like a doubled fist in his chest the mechanical hound turned and plunged away from fabers house down the alley again montag snapped his gaze to the sky the helicopters were closer a great blowing of insects to a single light source with an effort montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river it was in actuality his own chessgame he was witnessing move by move he shouted to give himself the necessary push away from this last house window and the fascinating sance going on in there hell and he was away and gone the alley a street the alley a street and the smell of the river leg out leg down leg out and down twenty million montags running soon if the cameras caught him twenty million montags running running like an ancient flickery keystone comedy cops robbers chasers and the chased hunters and hunted he had seen it a thousand times behind him now twenty million silently baying hounds ricocheted across parlors threecushion shooting from right wall to centre wall to left wall gone right wall centre wall left wall gone montag jammed his seashell to his ear police suggest entire population in the elm terrace area do as follows everyone in every house in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows the fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the next minute looks from his house ready of course why hadnt they done it before why in all the years hadnt this game been tried everyone up everyone out he couldnt be missed the only man running alone in the night city the only man proving his legs at the count of ten now one two he felt the city rise three he felt the city turn to its thousands of doors four the people sleepwalking in their hallways five he felt their hands on the doorknobs the smell of the river was cool and like a solid rain his throat was burnt rust and his eyes were wept dry with running he yelled as if this yell would jet him on fling him the last hundred yards six seven eight the doorknobs turned on five thousand doors nine he ran out away from the last row of houses on a slope leading down to a solid moving blackness ten the doors opened he imagined thousands on thousands of faces peering into yards into alleys and into the sky faces hid by curtains pale nightfrightened faces like grey animals peering from electric caves faces with grey colorless eyes grey tongues and grey thoughts looking out through the numb flesh of the face but he was at the river he touched it just to be sure it was real he waded in and stripped in darkness to the skin splashed his body arms legs and head with raw liquor drank it and snuffed some up his nose then he dressed in fabers old clothes and shoes he tossed his own clothing into the river and watched it swept away then holding the suitcase he walked out in the river until there was no bottom and he was swept away in the dark he was three hundred yards downstream when the hound reached the river overhead the great racketing fans of the helicopters hovered a storm of light fell upon the river and montag dived under the great illumination as if the sun had broken the clouds he felt the river pull him further on its way into darkness then the lights switched back to the land the helicopters swerved over the city again as if they had picked up another trail they were gone the hound was gone now there was only the cold river and montag floating in a sudden peacefulness away from the city and the lights and the chase away from everything he felt as if he had left a stage behind and many actors he felt as if he had left the great sance and all the murmuring ghosts he was moving from an unreality that was frightening into a reality that was unreal because it was new the black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills for the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out above him in great processions of wheeling fire he saw a great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him he floated on his back when the valise filled and sank the river was mild and leisurely going away from the people who ate shadows for breakfast and steam for lunch and vapours for supper the river was very real it held him comfortably and gave him the time at last the leisure to consider this month this year and a lifetime of years he listened to his heart slow his thoughts stopped rushing with his blood he saw the moon low in the sky now the moon there and the light of the moon caused by what by the sun of course and what lights the sun its own fire and the sun goes on day after day burning and burning the sun and time the sun and time and burning burning the river bobbled him along gently burning the sun and every clock on the earth it all came together and became a single thing in his mind after a long time of floating on the land and a short time of floating in the river he knew why he must never burn again in his life the sun burned every day it burned time the world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway without any help from him so if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt time that meant that everything burned one of them had to stop burning the sun wouldnt certainly so it looked as if it had to be montag and the people he had worked with until a few short hours ago somewhere the saving and putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping one way or another in books in records in peoples heads any way at all so long as it was safe free from moths silverfish rust and dryrot and men with matches the world was full of burning of all types and sizes now the guild of the asbestosweaver must open shop very soon he felt his heel bump land touch pebbles and rocks scrape sand the river had moved him toward shore he looked in at the great black creature without eyes or light without shape with only a size that went a thousand miles without wanting to stop with its grass hills and forests that were waiting for him he hesitated to leave the comforting flow of the water he expected the hound there suddenly the trees might blow under a great wind of helicopters but there was only the normal autumn wind high up going by like another river why wasnt the hound running why had the search veered inland montag listened nothing nothing millie he thought all this country here listen to it nothing and nothing so much silence millie i wonder how youd take it would you shout shut up shut up millie millie and he was sad millie was not here and the hound was not here but the dry smell of hay blowing from some distant field put montag on the land he remembered a farm he had visited when he was very young one of the rare times he had discovered that somewhere behind the seven veils of unreality beyond the walls of parlors and beyond the tin moat of the city cows chewed grass and pigs sat in warm ponds at noon and dogs barked after white sheep on a hill now the dry smell of hay the motion of the waters made him think of sleeping in fresh hay in a lonely barn away from the loud highways behind a quiet farmhouse and under an ancient windmill that whirred like the sound of the passing years overhead he lay in the high barn loft all night listening to distant animals and insects and trees the little motions and stirrings during the night he thought below the loft he would hear a sound like feet moving perhaps he would tense and sit up the sound would move away he would lie back and look out of the loft window very late in the night and see the lights go out in the farmhouse itself until a very young and beautiful woman would sit in an unlit window braiding her hair it would be hard to see her but her face would be like the face of the girl so long ago in his past now so very long ago the girl who had known the weather and never been burned by the fireflies the girl who had known what dandelions meant rubbed off on your chin then she would be gone from the warm window and appear again upstairs in her moonwhitened room and then to the sound of death the sound of the jets cutting the sky into two black pieces beyond the horizon he would lie in the loft hidden and safe watching those strange new stars over the rim of the earth fleeing from the soft color of dawn in the morning he would not have needed sleep for all the warm odors and sights of a complete country night would have rested and slept him while his eyes were wide and his mouth when he thought to test it was half a smile and there at the bottom of the hayloft stair waiting for him would be the incredible thing he would step carefully down in the pink light of early morning so fully aware of the world that he would be afraid and stand over the small miracle and at last bend to touch it a cool glass of fresh milk and a few apples and pears laid at the foot of the steps this was all he wanted now some sign that the immense world would accept him and give him the long time needed to think all the things that must be thought a glass of milk an apple a pear he stepped from the river the land rushed at him a tidal wave he was crushed by darkness and the look of the country and the million odors on a wind that iced his body he fell back under the breaking curve of darkness and sound and smell his ears roaring he whirled the stars poured over his sight like flaming meteors he wanted to plunge in the river again and let it idle him safely on down somewhere this dark land rising was like that day in his childhood swimming when from nowhere the largest wave in the history of remembering slammed him down in salt mud and green darkness water burning mouth and nose retching his stomach screaming too much water too much land out of the black wall before him a whisper a shape in the shape two eyes the night looking at him the forest seeing him the hound after all the running and rushing and sweating it out and halfdrowning to come this far work this hard and think yourself safe and sigh with relief and come out on the land at last only to find the hound montag gave one last agonized shout as if this were too much for any man the shape exploded away the eyes vanished the leaf piles flew up in a dry shower montag was alone in the wilderness a deer he smelled the heavy musklike perfume mingled with blood and the gummed exhalation of the animals breath all cardamom and moss and ragweed odor in this huge night where the trees ran at him pulled away ran pulled away to the pulse of the heart behind his eyes there must have been a billion leaves on the land he waded in them a dry river smelling of hot cloves and warm dust and the other smells there was a smell like a cut potato from all the land raw and cold and white from having the moon on it most of the night there was a smell like pickles from a bottle and a smell like parsley on the table at home there was a faint yellow odour like mustard from a jar there was a smell like carnations from the yard next door he put down his hand and felt a weed rise up like a child brushing him his fingers smelled of liquorice he stood breathing and the more he breathed the land in the more he was filled up with all the details of the land he was not empty there was more than enough here to fill him there would always be more than enough he walked in the shallow tide of leaves stumbling and in the middle of the strangeness a familiarity his foot hit something that rang dully he moved his hand on the ground a yard this way a yard that the railroad track the track that came out of the city and rusted across the land through forests and woods deserted now by the river here was the path to wherever he was going here was the single familiar thing the magic charm he might need a little while to touch to feel beneath his feet as he moved on into the bramble bushes and the lakes of smelling and feeling and touching among the whispers and the blowing down of leaves he walked on the track and he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove once long ago clarisse had walked here where he was walking now half an hour later cold and moving carefully on the tracks fully aware of his entire body his face his mouth his eyes stuffed with blackness his ears stuffed with sound his legs prickled with burrs and nettles he saw the fire ahead the fire was gone then back again like a winking eye he stopped afraid he might blow the fire out with a single breath but the fire was there and he approached warily from a long way off it took the better part of fifteen minutes before he drew very close indeed to it and then he stood looking at it from cover that small motion the white and red color a strange fire because it meant a different thing to him it was not burning it was warming he saw many hands held to its warmth hands without arms hidden in darkness above the hands motionless faces that were only moved and tossed and flickered with firelight he hadnt known fire could look this way he had never thought in his life that it could give as well as take even its smell was different how long he stood he did not know but there was a foolish and yet delicious sense of knowing himself as an animal come from the forest drawn by the fire he was a thing of brush and liquid eye of fur and muzzle and hoof he was a thing of horn and blood that would smell like autumn if you bled it out on the ground he stood a long long time listening to the warm crackle of the flames there was a silence gathered all about that fire and the silence was in the mens faces and time was there time enough to sit by this rusting track under the trees and look at the world and turn it over with the eyes as if it were held to the centre of the bonfire a piece of steel these men were all shaping it was not only the fire that was different it was the silence montag moved toward this special silence that was concerned with all of the world and then the voices began and they were talking and he could hear nothing of what the voices said but the sound rose and fell quietly and the voices were turning the world over and looking at it the voices knew the land and the trees and the city which lay down the track by the river the voices talked of everything there was nothing they could not talk about he knew from the very cadence and motion and continual stir of curiosity and wonder in them and then one of the men looked up and saw him for the first or perhaps the seventh time and a voice called to montag all right you can come out now montag stepped back into the shadows its all right the voice said youre welcome here montag walked slowly toward the fire and the five old men sitting there dressed in dark blue denim pants and jackets and dark blue suits he did not know what to say to them sit down said the man who seemed to be the leader of the small group have some coffee he watched the dark steaming mixture pour into a collapsible tin cup which was handed him straight off he sipped it gingerly and felt them looking at him with curiosity his lips were scalded but that was good the faces around him were bearded but the beards were clean neat and their hands were clean they had stood up as if to welcome a guest and now they sat down again montag sipped thanks he said thanks very much youre welcome montag my names granger he held out a small bottle of colourless fluid drink this too itll change the chemical index of your perspiration half an hour from now youll smell like two other people with the hound after you the best thing is bottoms up montag drank the bitter fluid youll stink like a bobcat but thats all right said granger you know my name said montag granger nodded to a portable battery tv set by the fire weve watched the chase figured youd wind up south along the river when we heard you plunging around out in the forest like a drunken elk we didnt hide as we usually do we figured you were in the river when the helicopter cameras swung back in over the city something funny there the chase is still running the other way though the other way lets have a look granger snapped the portable viewer on the picture was a nightmare condensed easily passed from hand to hand in the forest all whirring color and flight a voice cried the chase continues north in the city police helicopters are converging on avenue and elm grove park granger nodded theyre faking you threw them off at the river they cant admit it they know they can hold their audience only so long the shows got to have a snap ending quick if they started searching the whole damn river it might take all night so theyre sniffing for a scapegoat to end things with a bang watch theyll catch montag in the next five minutes but how watch the camera hovering in the belly of a helicopter now swung down at an empty street see that whispered granger itll be you right up at the end of that street is our victim see how our camera is coming in building the scene suspense long shot right now some poor fellow is out for a walk a rarity an odd one dont think the police dont know the habits of queer ducks like that men who walk mornings for the hell of it or for reasons of insomnia anyway the police have had him charted for months years never know when that sort of information might be handy and today it turns out its very usable indeed it saves face oh god look there the men at the fire bent forward on the screen a man turned a corner the mechanical hound rushed forward into the viewer suddenly the helicopter light shot down a dozen brilliant pillars that built a cage all about the man a voice cried theres montag the search is done the innocent man stood bewildered a cigarette burning in his hand he stared at the hound not knowing what it was he probably never knew he glanced up at the sky and the wailing sirens the cameras rushed down the hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful its needle shot out it was suspended for a moment in their gaze as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything the raw look of the victims face the empty street the steel animal a bullet nosing the target montag dont move said a voice from the sky the camera fell upon the victim even as did the hound both reached him simultaneously the victim was seized by hound and camera in a great spidering clenching grip he screamed he screamed he screamed blackout silence darkness montag cried out in the silence and turned away silence and then after a time of the men sitting around the fire their faces expressionless an announcer on the dark screen said the search is over montag is dead a crime against society has been avenged darkness we now take you to the sky room of the hotel lux for a halfhour of justbeforedawn a program of granger turned it off they didnt show the mans face in focus did you notice ven your best friends couldnt tell if it was you they scrambled it just enough to let the imagination take over hell he whispered hell montag said nothing but now looking back sat with his eyes fixed to the blank screen trembling granger touched montags arm welcome back from the dead montag nodded granger went on you might as well know all of us now this is fred clement former occupant of the thomas hardy chair at cambridge in the years before it became an atomic engineering school this other is dr simmons from ucla a specialist in ortega y gasset professor west here did quite a bit for ethics an ancient study now for columbia university quite some years ago reverend padover here gave a few lectures thirty years ago and lost his flock between one sunday and the next for his views hes been bumming with us some time now myself i wrote a book called the fingers in the glove the proper relationship between the individual and society and here i am welcome montag i dont belong with you said montag at last slowly ive been an idiot all the way were used to that we all made the right kind of mistakes or we wouldnt be here when we were separate individuals all we had was rage i struck a fireman when he came to burn my library years ago ive been running ever since you want to join us montag yes what have you to offer nothing i thought i had part of the book of ecclesiastes and maybe a little of revelation but i havent even that now the book of ecclesiastes would be fine where was it here montag touched his head ah granger smiled and nodded whats wrong isnt that all right said montag better than all right perfect granger turned to the reverend do we have a book of ecclesiastes one a man named harris of youngstown montag granger took montags shoulder firmly walk carefully guard your health if anything should happen to harris you are the book of ecclesiastes see how important youve become in the last minute but ive forgotten no nothings ever lost we have ways to shake down your clinkers for you but ive tried to remember dont try itll come when we need it all of us have photographic memories but spend a lifetime learning how to block off the things that are really in there simmons here has worked on it for twenty years and now weve got the method down to where we can recall anything thats been read once would you like some day montag to read platos republic of course i am platos republic like to read marcus aurelius mr simmons is marcus how do you do said mr simmons hello said montag i want you to meet jonathan swift the author of that evil political book gullivers travels and this other fellow is charles darwin andthis one is schopenhauer and this one is einstein and this one here at my elbow is mr albert schweitzer a very kind philosopher indeed here we all are montag aristophanes and mahatma gandhi and gautama buddha and confucius and thomas love peacock and thomas jefferson and mr lincoln if you please we are also matthew mark luke and john everyone laughed quietly it cant be said montag it is replied granger smiling were bookburners too we read the books and burnt them afraid theyd be found microfilming didnt pay off we were always travelling we didnt want to bury the film and come back later always the chance of discovery better to keep it in the old heads where no one can see it or suspect it we are all bits and pieces of history and literature and international law byron tom paine machiavelli or christ its here and the hour is late and the wars begun and we are out here and the city is there all wrapped up in its own coat of a thousand colours what do you think montag i think i was blind trying to do things my way planting books in firemens houses and sending in alarms you did what you had to do carried out on a national scale it might have worked beautifully but our way is simpler and we think better all we want to do is keep the knowledge we think we will need intact and safe were not out to incite or anger anyone yet for if we are destroyed the knowledge is dead perhaps for good we are model citizens in our own special way we walk the old tracks we lie in the hills at night and the city people let us be were stopped and searched occasionally but theres nothing on our persons to incriminate us the organization is flexible very loose and fragmentary some of us have had plastic surgery on our faces and fingerprints right now we have a horrible job were waiting for the war to begin and as quickly end its not pleasant but then were not in control were the odd minority crying in the wilderness when the wars over perhaps we can be of some use in the world do you really think theyll listen then if not well just have to wait well pass the books on to our children by word of mouth and let our children wait in turn on the other people a lot will be lost that way of course but you cant make people listen they have to come round in their own time wondering what happened and why the world blew up under them it cant last how many of you are there thousands on the roads the abandoned railtracks tonight bums on the outside libraries inside it wasnt planned at first each man had a book he wanted to remember and did then over a period of twenty years or so we met each other travelling and got the loose network together and set out a plan the most important single thing we had to pound into ourselves was that we were not important we mustnt be pedants we were not to feel superior to anyone else in the world were nothing more than dustjackets for books of no significance otherwise some of us live in small towns chapter one of thoreaus walden in green river chapter two in willow farm maine why theres one town in maryland only twentyseven people no bombll ever touch that town is the complete essays of a man named bertrand russell pick up that town almost and flip the pages so many pages to a person and when the wars over some day some year the books can be written again the people will be called in one by one to recite what they know and well set it up in type until another dark age when we might have to do the whole damn thing over again but thats the wonderful thing about man he never gets so discouraged or disgusted that he gives up doing it all over again because he knows very well it is important and worth the doing what do we do tonight asked montag wait said granger and move downstream a little way just in case he began throwing dust and dirt on the fire the other men helped and montag helped and there in the wilderness the men all moved their hands putting out the fire together they stood by the river in the starlight montag saw the luminous dial of his waterproof five five oclock in the morning another year ticked by in a single hour and dawn waiting beyond the far bank of the river why do you trust me said montag a man moved in the darkness the look of yous enough you havent seen yourself in a mirror lately beyond that the city has never cared so much about us to bother with an elaborate chase like this to find us a few crackpots with verses in their heads cant touch them and they know it and we know it everyone knows it so long as the vast population doesnt wander about quoting the magna charta and the constitution its all right the firemen were enough to check that now and then no the cities dont bother us and you look like hell they moved along the bank of the river going south montag tried to see the mens faces the old faces he remembered from the firelight lined and tired he was looking for a brightness a resolve a triumph over tomorrow that hardly seemed to be there perhaps he had expected their faces to burn and glitter with the knowledge they carried to glow as lanterns glow with the light in them but all the light had come from the camp fire and these men had seemed no different from any others who had run a long race searched a long search seen good things destroyed and now very late were gathering to wait for the end of the party and the blowing out of the lamps they werent at all certain that the things they carried in their heads might make every future dawn glow with a purer light they were sure of nothing save that the books were on file behind their quiet eyes the books were waiting with their pages uncut for the customers who might come by in later years some with clean and some with dirty fingers montag squinted from one face to another as they walked dont judge a book by its cover someone said and they all laughed quietly moving downstream there was a shriek and the jets from the city were gone overhead long before the men looked up montag stared back at the city far down the river only a faint glow now my wifes back there im sorry to hear that the cities wont do well in the next few days said granger its strange i dont miss her its strange i dont feel much of anything said montag even if she dies i realized a moment ago i dont think ill feel sad it isnt right something must be wrong with me listen said granger taking his arm and walking with him holding aside the bushes to let him pass when i was a boy my grandfather died and he was a sculptor he was also a very kind man who had a lot of love to give the world and he helped clean up the slum in our town and he made toys for us and he did a million things in his lifetime he was always busy with his hands and when he died i suddenly realized i wasnt crying for him at all but for the things he did i cried because he would never do them again he would never carve another piece of wood or help us raise doves and pigeons in the back yard or play the violin the way he did or tell us jokes the way he did he was part of us and when he died all the actions stopped dead and there was no one to do them just the way he did he was individual he was an important man ive never gotten over his death often i think what wonderful carvings never came to birth because he died how many jokes are missing from the world and how many homing pigeons untouched by his hands he shaped the world he did things to the world the world was bankrupted of ten million fine actions the night he passed on montag walked in silence millie millie he whispered millie what my wife my wife poor millie poor millie i cant remember anything i think of her hands but i dont see them doing anything at all they just hang there at her sides or they lie there on her lap or theres a cigarette in them but thats all montag turned and glanced back what did you give to the city montag ashes what did the others give to each other nothingness granger stood looking back with montag everyone must leave something behind when he dies my grandfather said a child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made or a garden planted something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted youre there it doesnt matter what you do he said so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something thats like you after you take your hands away the difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching he said the lawncutter might just as well not have been there at all the gardener will be there a lifetime granger moved his hand my grandfather showed me some v rocket films once fifty years ago have you ever seen the atombomb mushroom from two hundred miles up its a pinprick its nothing with the wilderness all around it my grandfather ran off the v rocket film a dozen times and then hoped that some day our cities would open up and let the green and the land and the wilderness in more to remind people that were allotted a little space on earth and that we survive in that wilderness that can take back what it has given as easily as blowing its breath on us or sending the sea to tell us we are not so big when we forget how close the wilderness is in the night my grandpa said some day it will come in and get us for we will have forgotten how terrible and real it can be you see granger turned to montag grandfathers been dead for all these years but if you lifted my skull by god in the convolutions of my brain youd find the big ridges of his thumbprint he touched me as i said earlier he was a sculptor i hate a roman named status quo he said to me stuff your eyes with wonder he said live as if youd drop dead in ten seconds see the world its more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories ask no guarantees ask for no security there never was such an animal and if there were it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day sleeping its life away to hell with that he said shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass look cried montag and the war began and ended in that instant later the men around montag could not say if they had really seen anything perhaps the merest flourish of light and motion in the sky perhaps the bombs were there and the jets ten miles five miles one mile up for the merest instant like grain thrown over the heavens by a great sowing hand and the bombs drifting with dreadful swiftness yet sudden slowness down upon the morning city they had left behind the bombardment was to all intents and purposes finished once the jets had sighted their target alerted their bombardiers at five thousand miles an hour as quick as the whisper of a scythe the war was finished once the bombrelease was yanked it was over now a full three seconds all of the time in history before the bombs struck the enemy ships themselves were gone half around the visible world like bullets in which a savage islander might not believe because they were invisible yet the heart is suddenly shattered the body falls in separate motions and the blood is astonished to be freed on the air the brain squanders its few precious memories and puzzled dies this was not to be believed it was merely a gesture montag saw the flirt of a great metal fist over the far city and he knew the scream of the jets that would follow would say after the deed disintegrate leave no stone on another perish die montag held the bombs in the sky for a single moment with his mind and his hands reaching helplessly up at them run he cried to faber to clarisse run to mildred get out get out of there but clarisse he remembered was dead and faber was out there in the deep valleys of the country somewhere the five am bus was on its way from one desolation to another though the desolation had not yet arrived was still in the air it was certain as man could make it before the bus had run another fifty yards on the highway its destination would be meaningless and its point of departure changed from metropolis to junkyard and mildred get out run he saw her in her hotel room somewhere now in the halfsecond remaining with the bombs a yard a foot an inch from her building he saw her leaning toward the great shimmering walls of colour and motion where the family talked and talked and talked to her where the family prattled and chatted and said her name and smiled at her and said nothing of the bomb that was an inch now a halfinch now a quarterinch from the top of the hotel leaning into the wall as if all of the hunger of looking would find the secret of her sleepless unease there mildred leaning anxiously nervously as if to plunge drop fall into that swarming immensity of color to drown in its bright happiness the first bomb struck mildred perhaps who would ever know perhaps the great broadcasting stations with their beams of color and light and talk and chatter went first into oblivion montag falling flat going down saw or felt or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in millies face heard her screaming because in the millionth part of time left she saw her own face reflected there in a mirror instead of a crystal ball and it was such a wildly empty face all by itself in the room touching nothing starved and eating of itself that at last she recognized it as her own and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her carrying her with a million pounds of brick metal plaster and wood to meet other people in the hives below all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in its own unreasonable way i remember montag clung to the earth i remember chicago chicago a long time ago millie and i thats where we met i remember now chicago a long time ago the concussion knocked the air across and down the river turned the men over like dominoes in a line blew the water in lifting sprays and blew the dust and made the trees above them mourn with a great wind passing away south montag crushed himself down squeezing himself small eyes tight he blinked once and in that instant saw the city instead of the bombs in the air they had displaced each other for another of those impossible instants the city stood rebuilt and unrecognizable taller than it had ever hoped or strived to be taller than man had built it erected at last in gouts of shattered concrete and sparkles of torn metal into a mural hung like a reversed avalanche a million colours a million oddities a door where a window should be a top for a bottom a side for a back and then the city rolled over and fell down dead the sound of its death came after montag lying there eyes gritted shut with dust a fine wet cement of dust in his now shut mouth gasping and crying now thought again i remember i remember i remember something else what is it yes yes part of the ecclesiastes and revelation part of that book part of it quick now quick before it gets away before the shock wears off before the wind dies book of ecclesiastes here he said it over to himself silently lying flat to the trembling earth he said the words of it many times and they were perfect without trying and there was no denhams dentifrice anywhere it was just the preacher by himself standing there in his mind looking at him there said a voice the men lay gasping like fish laid out on the grass they held to the earth as children hold to familiar things no matter how cold or dead no matter what has happened or will happen their fingers were clawed into the dirt and they were all shouting to keep their eardrums from bursting to keep their sanity from bursting mouths open montag shouting with them a protest against the wind that ripped their faces and tore at their lips making their noses bleed montag watched the great dust settle and the great silence move down upon their world and lying there it seemed that he saw every single grain of dust and every blade of grass and that he heard every cry and shout and whisper going up in the world now silence fell down in the sifting dust and all the leisure they might need to look around to gather the reality of this day into their senses montag looked at the river well go on the river he looked at the old railroad tracks or well go that way or well walk on the highways now and well have time to put things into ourselves and some day after it sets in us a long time itll come out of our hands and our mouths and a lot of it will be wrong but just enough of it will be right well just start walking today and see the world and the way the world walks around and talks the way it really looks i want to see everything now and while none of it will be me when it goes in after a while itll all gather together inside and itll be me look at the world out there my god my god look at it out there outside me out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where its finally me where its in the blood where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day i get hold of it so itll never run off ill hold on to the world tight some day ive got one finger on it now thats a beginning the wind died the other men lay a while on the dawn edge of sleep not yet ready to rise up and begin the days obligations its fires and foods its thousand details of putting foot after foot and hand after hand they lay blinking their dusty eyelids you could hear them breathing fast then slower then slow montag sat up he did not move any further however the other men did likewise the sun was touching the black horizon with a faint red tip the air was cold and smelled of a coming rain silently granger arose felt his arms and legs swearing swearing incessantly under his breath tears dripping from his face he shuffled down to the river to look upstream its flat he said a long time later city looks like a heap of bakingpowder its gone and a long time after that i wonder how many knew it was coming i wonder how many were surprised and across the world thought montag how many other cities dead and here in our country how many a hundred a thousand someone struck a match and touched it to a piece of dry paper taken from their pocket and shoved this under a bit of grass and leaves and after a while added tiny twigs which were wet and sputtered but finally caught and the fire grew larger in the early morning as the sun came up and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn to the fire awkwardly with nothing to say and the sun colored the backs of their necks as they bent down granger unfolded an oilskin with some bacon in it well have a bite then well turn around and walk upstream theyll be needing us up that way someone produced a small fryingpan and the bacon went into it and the fryingpan was set on the fire after a moment the bacon began to flutter and dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the morning air with its aroma the men watched this ritual silently granger looked into the fire phoenix what there was a silly damn bird called a phoenix back before christ every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up he must have been first cousin to man but every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes he got himself born all over again and it looks like were doing the same thing over and over but weve got one damn thing the phoenix never had we know the damn silly thing we just did we know all the damn silly things weve done for a thousand years and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it some day well stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them we pick up a few more people that remember every generation he took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it slowly thoughtfully now lets get on upstream said granger and hold on to one thought youre not important youre not anything some day the load were carrying with us may help someone but even when we had the books on hand a long time ago we didnt use what we got out of them we went right on insulting the dead we went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us were going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month and the next year and when they ask us what were doing you can say were remembering thats where well win out in the long run and some day well remember so much that well build the biggest goddam steamshovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up come on now were going to go build a mirrorfactory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them they finished eating and put out the fire the day was brightening all about them as if a pink lamp had been given more wick in the trees the birds that had flown away now came back and settled down montag began walking and after a moment found that the others had fallen in behind him going north he was surprised and moved aside to let granger pass but granger looked at him and nodded him on montag went ahead he looked at the river and the sky and the rusting track going back down to where the farms lay where the barns stood full of hay where a lot of people had walked by in the night on their way from the city later in a month or six months and certainly not more than a year he would walk along here again alone and keep right on going until he caught up with the people but now there was a long mornings walk until noon and if the men were silent it was because there was everything to think about and much to remember perhaps later in the morning when the sun was up and had warmed them they would begin to talk or just say the things they remembered to be sure they were there to be absolutely certain that things were safe in them montag felt the slow stir of words the slow simmer and when it came to his turn what could he say what could he offer on a day like this to make the trip a little easier to everything there is a season yes a time to break down and a time to build up yes a time to keep silence and a time to speak yes all that but what else what else something something and on either side of the river was there a tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations yes thought montag thats the one ill save for noon for noon when we reach the city
