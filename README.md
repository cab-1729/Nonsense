# Nonsense
Generates nonsense

Feed the program data to generate a string of words that don't feel random but don't make sense either

how to use:
>>>python nonsense1 --data="txt file with data" --store="clipboard to use clipboard, filename to store in a file" --length=number of words in nonsense [--seed="any word that is in data"] [--delim="delimeter used in data, default is space"]

data must be from a text that makes sense, all words from the text are kept serially in a single file separated using spaces maintaining order
example using Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451" is provided
